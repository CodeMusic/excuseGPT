[2024-05-23, 10:26:11 AM] Adam: Let me explain.
[2024-05-23, 12:04:54 PM] Zoe: This isn’t going to be easy for me. I still have feelings for Chris. It’s not like I desire to break up with him. I just wish he would see me more and reign in spending. It’s very hard for me to make a jump into this when I tell you I had the best year of my life with him. I think you think I am chasing him because he’s not giving me what I want right now. But I need for you to recognize that this isn’t easy for me. Yes I have to do what’s best for myself but I can also mourn and also take time. I don’t even think he and I are over just based on him saying he wants to see if I pass a test. <This message was edited>

[2024-05-23, 12:32:34 PM] Adam: I think I can respect that and I will do the honorable thing honestly and bow out.
[2024-05-23, 12:32:47 PM] Adam: You don't need to meet up with me and you can reassure him that I don't intend on doing.
[2024-05-23, 12:32:56 PM] Zoe: Okay

[2024-05-23, 12:33:15 PM] Adam: I mean what else can I say ?
[2024-05-23, 12:33:26 PM] Adam: You don't want to meet up... I get it.
[2024-05-23, 12:33:28 PM] Zoe: That you can be patient and you understand

[2024-05-23, 12:34:00 PM] Adam: It's either you're okay meeting up or you're not...
[2024-05-23, 12:34:07 PM] Zoe: Patient for me to figure out my feelings
[2024-05-23, 12:34:07 PM] Adam: Not sure what other option there is in this scenario.

[2024-05-23, 2:15:25 PM] Adam: Here's a thought
[2024-05-23, 2:15:30 PM] Adam: Why can't you focus on yourself
[2024-05-23, 2:15:35 PM] Adam: And a summer of fun
[2024-05-23, 2:16:46 PM] Zoe: Maybe I need to feel a separation from him before I can move forward
[2024-05-23, 2:17:05 PM] Zoe: And I don’t know what I’m ready for
[2024-05-23, 2:17:32 PM] Zoe: It’s too soon. I am going to have a summer of fun anyways

[2024-05-23, 2:17:55 PM] Zoe: You told me
[2024-05-23, 2:18:32 PM] Adam: When you phrase it like that
[2024-05-23, 2:18:45 PM] Adam: It sounds forceful which is super weird lol
[2024-05-23, 2:19:13 PM] Adam: I was just making it clear that I would definitely like to get intimate, of course I can't deny that
[2024-05-23, 2:19:24 PM] Adam: There's sexual tension
[2024-05-23, 2:19:26 PM] Adam: That's obvious
[2024-05-23, 2:21:17 PM] Zoe: I wouldn’t want to be sexual
[2024-05-23, 2:21:21 PM] Zoe: 100%

[2024-05-23, 2:21:58 PM] Zoe: None of that
[2024-05-23, 2:22:10 PM] Zoe: Would you still meet me if I didn’t want to touch you?
[2024-05-23, 2:22:25 PM] Adam: Who said I want to be touched lol ?
[2024-05-23, 2:22:37 PM] Zoe: Cuddled
[2024-05-23, 2:22:39 PM] Zoe: Hugged
[2024-05-23, 2:22:50 PM] Adam: But you can't be that naive to think you're gonna meet up with your ex you haven't seen in a long time
[2024-05-23, 2:23:05 PM] Adam: And be so certain that it would raise tensions
[2024-05-23, 2:23:13 PM] Adam: Wouldn't"
[2024-05-23, 2:23:30 PM] Zoe: I will not touch you, you have to understand that before so your expectations

[2024-06-01, 12:48:49 PM] Zoe: I should give back
[2024-06-01, 12:49:02 PM] Adam: What does that have anything to do with it lol ?
[2024-06-01, 12:49:05 PM] Zoe: I could block you… or I could just be rude until you block me

[2024-06-01, 12:52:56 PM] Zoe: Ridiculous
[2024-06-01, 12:53:27 PM] Adam: Who on earth said forget everything and why would you hold onto the past to determine how to treat someone in the present ?
[2024-06-01, 12:53:33 PM] Adam: That's not very nice of you
[2024-06-01, 12:54:45 PM] Zoe: If I was nice you would have liked me
[2024-06-01, 12:55:01 PM] Zoe: You would have treated me better?
[2024-06-01, 1:00:25 PM] Adam: I didn't mistreat you because you mistreated me...sometimes people interact and friction is caused and their ugly side comes out..doesn't dictate people or define them entirely
[2024-06-01, 1:03:26 PM] Zoe: Is your mom Persian or Arab?

[2024-06-03, 2:30:00 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-03, 2:30:10 PM] Adam: Definitely don't miss WhatsApp
[2024-06-03, 2:30:13 PM] Adam: I miss being in person
[2024-06-03, 2:32:13 PM] Adam: What if we made an oath
[2024-06-03, 2:32:16 PM] Adam: To keep it platonic
[2024-06-03, 2:32:26 PM] Adam: Can we then hangout at yours and watch movies and chill ?
[2024-06-03, 2:32:39 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-03, 2:32:46 PM] Adam: Why
[2024-06-03, 2:32:59 PM] Adam: If it's purely platonic
[2024-06-03, 2:33:06 PM] Zoe: Cause I don’t want to invite you to my place
[2024-06-03, 2:33:09 PM] Zoe: You moving in?
[2024-06-03, 2:33:13 PM] Adam: 😂😂
[2024-06-03, 2:33:23 PM] Adam: For 2 weeks ?
[2024-06-03, 2:34:09 PM] Adam: Look it's better than being outside
[2024-06-03, 2:34:17 PM] Adam: At least then you get to enjoy the things you love
[2024-06-03, 2:34:23 PM] Adam: Spending quality time together
[2024-06-03, 2:34:25 PM] Adam: We can cook
[2024-06-03, 2:34:29 PM] Adam: Watch shows and movies
[2024-06-03, 9:33:12 PM] Zoe: I really won’t invite you into my house, I need you to respect that
[2024-06-03, 9:34:18 PM] Zoe: I don’t mind meeting up if you want to.  But I’d want to meet up around 6
[2024-06-03, 9:34:46 PM] Zoe: If you can’t do these things I think I know what you’re after
[2024-06-03, 9:35:08 PM] Zoe: And if we don’t meet up because you can’t respect that I’d understand.
[2024-06-04, 8:29:38 AM] Adam: Lol haven't I been honest tho
[2024-06-04, 8:29:58 AM] Adam: I mean it's pretty obvious what I'd love but not all I want
[2024-06-04, 8:30:34 AM] Zoe: But I’m for certain not going to be romantic with you
[2024-06-04, 8:30:42 AM] Zoe: Sexual/
[2024-06-04, 8:30:48 AM] Zoe: Not going to cuddle
[2024-06-04, 8:30:57 AM] Zoe: If you still want to meet, fine
[2024-06-04, 8:31:01 AM] Adam: Why not ?
[2024-06-04, 8:31:09 AM] Zoe: I’m just not going to be
[2024-06-04, 8:31:12 AM] Adam: You are worried it may end things with him ?
[2024-06-04, 8:31:56 AM] Zoe: I don’t want to be sexual with someone without knowing it has a legitimate chance
[2024-06-04, 8:32:33 AM] Zoe: If you can’t respect that, your loss
[2024-06-04, 8:32:54 AM] Adam: Here's what I don't get
[2024-06-04, 8:33:01 AM] Adam: Why do you want to make it a nail in the coffin
[2024-06-04, 8:33:05 AM] Adam: Why not just be relaxed
[2024-06-04, 8:33:08 AM] Adam: And go with the flow
[2024-06-04, 8:33:18 AM] Adam: Why do you have to put up so many guardrails
[2024-06-04, 8:33:32 AM] Zoe: I don’t want to. If you want to go with the flow with someone else by all means.
[2024-06-04, 8:34:05 AM] Zoe: I put up guardrails for my safety. I am trying to find a lifelong loving relationship
[2024-06-04, 8:34:24 AM] Adam: So we can't go camping?
[2024-06-04, 8:35:23 AM] Zoe: No I would want to “go with the flow” and figure out what’s appropriate. I understand if you don’t want to meet.
[2024-06-04, 8:37:26 AM] Adam: Huuuuuh
[2024-06-04, 8:37:32 AM] Adam: What does that mean
[2024-06-04, 8:38:38 AM] Zoe: Means I ain’t going to be sexual with you. I’m not here for your entertainment
[2024-06-04, 8:42:29 AM] Adam: It's not sexual
[2024-06-04, 8:42:33 AM] Adam: It's camping
[2024-06-04, 8:42:46 AM] Adam: So why not ?
[2024-06-04, 8:45:35 AM] Zoe: I’m not sure we would get along for that long
[2024-06-04, 8:50:27 AM] Adam: It's a good trial
[2024-06-04, 8:50:32 AM] Adam: Isn't it ?
[2024-06-04, 8:51:36 AM] Adam: What could go wrong ?
[2024-06-04, 8:51:43 AM] Adam: Us coming home early ?
[2024-06-04, 8:51:46 AM] Zoe: You could starve
[2024-06-04, 8:52:03 AM] Adam: We can share a tent and have two blankets and a pillow between us
[2024-06-04, 8:52:05 AM] Adam: Keep it halal
[2024-06-04, 8:52:13 AM] Zoe: That’s not halal
[2024-06-04, 8:52:28 AM] Zoe: You’re trying to get under my skin
[2024-06-04, 8:52:34 AM] Zoe: You’re like a brother
[2024-06-04, 8:52:34 AM] Adam: How ?
[2024-06-04, 8:52:38 AM] Adam: Two blankets and a pillow ?
[2024-06-04, 8:52:46 AM] Zoe: Yeah buddy
[2024-06-04, 8:52:58 AM] Adam: How can I get under your skin
[2024-06-04, 8:53:32 AM] Adam: You mean in your pants
[2024-06-04, 8:53:34 AM] Adam: Or under your skin
[2024-06-04, 8:53:43 AM] Zoe: All of that
[2024-06-04, 8:53:43 AM] Adam: Those are 2 different things
[2024-06-04, 8:53:53 AM] Adam: Ok so you want 2 tents ?
[2024-06-04, 8:54:04 AM] Zoe: 2 tents and a chaperone
[2024-06-04, 8:54:09 AM] Adam: Definitely not
[2024-06-04, 8:54:12 AM] Adam: I am saying one tent
[2024-06-04, 8:54:15 AM] Adam: Two blankets
[2024-06-04, 8:54:15 AM] Zoe: Oh well
[2024-06-04, 8:54:18 AM] Adam: Hands to ourselves
[2024-06-04, 8:54:30 AM] Adam: You can't touch me
[2024-06-04, 8:54:34 AM] Adam: And I can touch you
[2024-06-04, 8:54:41 AM] Zoe: What happened to Cuba two rooms
[2024-06-04, 8:54:52 AM] Adam: Might not have time for that
[2024-06-04, 8:55:26 AM] Adam: How about
[2024-06-04, 8:55:35 AM] Adam: One blanket, butt naked skin and skin warmth ?
[2024-06-04, 8:55:37 AM] Zoe: How about just meeting
[2024-06-04, 8:55:38 AM] Adam: 😂
[2024-06-04, 8:55:47 AM] Zoe: Ok guess you don’t want to meet
[2024-06-04, 8:55:50 AM] Zoe: Which is fine
[2024-06-04, 8:55:50 AM] Adam: Spooning naked under one blanket
[2024-06-04, 8:55:54 AM] Adam: That is amazing
[2024-06-04, 8:55:58 AM] Zoe: You’re just trying to annoy me
[2024-06-04, 8:56:01 AM] Adam: How ?
[2024-06-04, 8:56:06 AM] Adam: Does that not sound amazing tho
[2024-06-04, 8:56:24 AM] Zoe: You are jeopardizing us meeting, meaning you don’t care about us meeting
[2024-06-04, 8:56:53 AM] Zoe: Which is fine cause I’m kind of indifferent now too
[2024-06-04, 8:57:06 AM] Adam: Why?
[2024-06-04, 8:57:26 AM] Zoe: Cause you tryna push stuff, and I’m not for that… and you know it
[2024-06-04, 8:57:37 AM] Zoe: We probably won’t meet
[2024-06-04, 8:57:39 AM] Zoe: Tbh
[2024-06-04, 8:59:15 AM] Adam: You know
[2024-06-04, 8:59:21 AM] Adam: You wake up with different moods lol
[2024-06-04, 8:59:29 AM] Adam: Today I got this one, tomorrow it'll be different.
[2024-06-04, 8:59:41 AM] Zoe: I’ve never woken up with a mood that says I want to go camping with you
[2024-06-04, 8:59:48 AM] Zoe: Or that I want to fuck you
[2024-06-04, 8:59:53 AM] Zoe: Or get physical
[2024-06-04, 8:59:56 AM] Zoe: That’s in your mind
[2024-06-04, 9:00:05 AM] Zoe: Only that I’m willing to meet
[2024-06-04, 9:00:08 AM] Adam: No but you did say maybe to camping
[2024-06-04, 9:00:13 AM] Zoe: So I’m actually staying true to myself
[2024-06-04, 9:01:10 AM] Adam: I'm sure you did say maybe
[2024-06-04, 9:01:14 AM] Adam: To the camping trip
[2024-06-04, 9:01:29 AM] Zoe: Where

[2024-06-04, 9:06:40 AM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-04, 9:06:44 AM] Adam: I mean
[2024-06-04, 9:06:51 AM] Adam: 2 blankets and a pillow in between
[2024-06-04, 9:06:56 AM] Adam: Like a barrier
[2024-06-04, 9:07:03 AM] Zoe: K bro
[2024-06-04, 9:07:08 AM] Adam: So separate blankets and a giant wall in the middle
[2024-06-04, 9:07:13 AM] Adam: Isn't that appropriate
[2024-06-04, 9:07:19 AM] Zoe: Not halal
[2024-06-04, 9:07:23 AM] Zoe: Bring a chaperone
[2024-06-04, 9:08:00 AM] Adam: You don't need one
[2024-06-04, 9:08:08 AM] Zoe: Why?
[2024-06-04, 9:08:23 AM] Adam: We'll do temp marriage 😂
[2024-06-04, 9:08:31 AM] Zoe: Why?

[2024-06-04, 9:10:16 AM] Adam: Don't you want to keep it halal
[2024-06-04, 9:10:34 AM] Zoe: I don’t go for your temp marriages anymore, it’s bs
[2024-06-04, 9:20:21 AM] Adam: Wait
[2024-06-04, 9:20:29 AM] Adam: It's to keep it halal
[2024-06-04, 9:20:36 AM] Adam: Better than a chaperone

[2024-06-04, 2:19:24 PM] Adam: I think she was just eyeing my body
[2024-06-04, 2:19:45 PM] Zoe: Maybe but girls don’t just go for guys cause they’re cute
[2024-06-04, 2:19:54 PM] Zoe: They have to have the right attitude for them
[2024-06-04, 2:20:05 PM] Adam: No I think they could also go for guys. They find hot
[2024-06-04, 2:20:27 PM] Zoe: She’s brave so maybe
[2024-06-04, 2:20:31 PM] Adam: She seemed like she wanted to get in my pants
[2024-06-04, 2:20:36 PM] Zoe: Geeez relax
[2024-06-04, 2:20:54 PM] Zoe: Maybe see if she has the same house layout as you first
[2024-06-04, 2:21:09 PM] Adam: What does that mean
[2024-06-04, 2:21:20 PM] Zoe: Teaching you
[2024-06-04, 2:21:34 PM] Zoe: Excuse to get her to your apartment
[2024-06-04, 2:21:40 PM] Zoe: Was she hijab?
[2024-06-04, 2:21:44 PM] Adam: No, of course not
[2024-06-04, 2:22:04 PM] Zoe: I dunno
[2024-06-04, 2:22:12 PM] Adam: She was wearing spandex
[2024-06-04, 2:22:14 PM] Zoe: Have you ever dated a hijabi?
[2024-06-04, 2:22:19 PM] Zoe: Nice body?
[2024-06-04, 2:22:21 PM] Adam: Nope
[2024-06-04, 2:22:30 PM] Zoe: Saving that for marriage?
[2024-06-04, 2:22:33 PM] Adam: So if I sleep with her would you still meet up with me?
[2024-06-04, 2:22:42 PM] Zoe: Sure why not
[2024-06-04, 2:22:53 PM] Zoe: It’s your prerogative
[2024-06-04, 2:23:07 PM] Adam: Okay just making sure
[2024-06-04, 2:23:16 PM] Zoe: Did you msg her yet
[2024-06-04, 2:23:25 PM] Zoe: I wonder how it will all go down
[2024-06-04, 2:23:28 PM] Zoe: It’s very exciting
[2024-06-04, 2:23:33 PM] Zoe: I never talk to new people
[2024-06-04, 2:25:02 PM] Adam: Do you honestly think
[2024-06-04, 2:25:07 PM] Adam: This is my first time messaging a girl lol
[2024-06-04, 2:25:18 PM] Adam: The reason I brought this one up is because she was the one who initiated
[2024-06-04, 2:25:31 PM] Adam: These things don't interest me like they do for you
[2024-06-04, 2:27:28 PM] Zoe: What things don’t interest you
[2024-06-04, 2:28:01 PM] Zoe: Do you honestly think I honestly think that this is your first time messaging a girl? 🤓 why are you so naive
[2024-06-04, 2:30:01 PM] Adam: Because the way you're reacting lol
[2024-06-04, 2:30:07 PM] Adam: You're acting like I should marry this girl
[2024-06-04, 2:30:33 PM] Zoe: No… I’m acting like you should see what’s up…
[2024-06-04, 2:30:45 PM] Zoe: And I get to hear it through you so it’s interesting
[2024-06-04, 2:31:12 PM] Adam: Nah
[2024-06-04, 2:31:27 PM] Adam: So you'd still want to see me if I slept with a girl ?
[2024-06-04, 2:35:31 PM] Zoe: If that’s means you’re less sexual with me
[2024-06-04, 2:35:51 PM] Zoe: I don’t mind meeting you if you e been with a girl
[2024-06-04, 2:36:10 PM] Zoe: I’m somewhat attached to you… doesn’t mean I need you sexually
[2024-06-04, 2:36:20 PM] Zoe: Maybe just attached so I can argue
[2024-06-04, 2:36:46 PM] Adam: Probably won't mean that 😂😂😂
[2024-06-04, 2:37:09 PM] Zoe: Lame
[2024-06-04, 2:37:15 PM] Adam: I think it's just craziness maybe that I like
[2024-06-04, 2:37:20 PM] Adam: Crazy, angry, mad sex
[2024-06-04, 2:37:37 PM] Zoe: Sounds like this girl is crazy
[2024-06-04, 2:37:57 PM] Adam: Like after arguing with you
[2024-06-04, 2:38:09 PM] Adam: I kinda just want to ....
[2024-06-04, 2:39:15 PM] Adam: Tackle you
[2024-06-04, 2:42:29 PM] Zoe: And I want to pull your hair out
[2024-06-04, 2:42:44 PM] Adam: That's pretty erotic
[2024-06-04, 2:43:06 PM] Zoe: See
[2024-06-04, 2:43:10 PM] Zoe: You don’t like me
[2024-06-04, 2:43:14 PM] Adam: Why ?
[2024-06-04, 2:43:17 PM] Zoe: You like what you want to do to me
[2024-06-04, 2:43:27 PM] Adam: Lol ok so let's just assume that's true..
[2024-06-04, 2:43:34 PM] Adam: Why wouldn't I go invest all this time into this girl ?
[2024-06-04, 2:43:41 PM] Adam: If all I want is just sex ?
[2024-06-04, 2:43:49 PM] Adam: A) it wouldn't take nearly as much effort
[2024-06-04, 2:43:57 PM] Adam: B) I can get it here and now
[2024-06-04, 2:44:06 PM] Adam: C) I don't have to deal with any arguments or whatever else
[2024-06-04, 2:44:55 PM] Zoe: This
[2024-06-04, 2:45:14 PM] Adam: Lol it's much easier finding crazy girls than it is finding ones that are same
[2024-06-04, 2:45:16 PM] Adam: Sane
[2024-06-04, 2:45:18 PM] Zoe: And you don’t have the “upset” repor with her
[2024-06-04, 2:45:34 PM] Adam: You'll say anything
[2024-06-04, 2:45:38 PM] Adam: Just to avoid the fact that
[2024-06-04, 2:45:46 PM] Adam: It's tied to emotions and feelings
[2024-06-04, 2:45:46 PM] Zoe: Rapport
[2024-06-04, 2:46:05 PM] Zoe: I guess I don’t understand how you can treat someone so poorly
[2024-06-04, 2:46:11 PM] Zoe: That you pretend to like
[2024-06-04, 2:46:28 PM] Adam: Poorly ?

[2024-06-04, 4:11:37 PM] Zoe: Isn’t that funny
[2024-06-04, 4:11:46 PM] Zoe: He doesn’t know how annoying I find you

[2024-06-05, 7:37:44 PM] Zoe: It probably not a good idea for us to meet up. It’s not going to go anywhere. It will just frustrate you.
[2024-06-06, 1:14:52 AM] Adam: Why will it frustrate me?
[2024-06-06, 8:09:34 AM] Zoe: Cause you get annoyed when I don’t give you sex
[2024-06-06, 8:09:56 AM] Adam: Don't want sex
[2024-06-06, 8:10:06 AM] Zoe: What do you want?
[2024-06-06, 8:10:21 AM] Adam: Them titties
[2024-06-06, 8:10:26 AM] Zoe: See
[2024-06-06, 8:10:32 AM] Adam: That's not sex 😂
[2024-06-06, 8:10:45 AM] Adam: GIF omitted
[2024-06-06, 8:11:04 AM] Zoe: GIF omitted
[2024-06-06, 8:11:24 AM] Adam: That's not sex
[2024-06-06, 8:11:42 AM] Adam: You gotta admit it's not the same.
[2024-06-06, 8:14:01 AM] Zoe: Sure but you won’t see my tits
[2024-06-06, 8:15:04 AM] Adam: We'll see
[2024-06-06, 8:15:10 AM] Adam: About that 😈😈😈
[2024-06-06, 8:28:27 AM] Adam: Lol no ?
[2024-06-06, 8:53:45 AM] Zoe: Nope
[2024-06-06, 8:55:29 AM] Adam: I'm coming from wm
[2024-06-06, 8:55:29 AM] Adam: Em
[2024-06-06, 8:55:36 AM] Adam: They're all mine
[2024-06-06, 8:55:50 AM] Zoe: No look no touch
[2024-06-06, 8:56:27 AM] Adam: I'll settle for look
[2024-06-06, 8:56:28 AM] Adam: No touch
[2024-06-06, 8:56:31 AM] Adam: 😈
[2024-06-06, 8:56:35 AM] Adam: That seems very fair
[2024-06-06, 9:01:40 AM] Zoe: Sure you can stare with my clothing on
[2024-06-06, 9:01:56 AM] Adam: Helllll naaaaaah
[2024-06-06, 9:02:00 AM] Adam: Everyone can see that
[2024-06-06, 9:02:08 AM] Zoe: Yup
[2024-06-06, 9:02:08 AM] Adam: I need some form of exclusive access
[2024-06-06, 9:02:16 AM] Adam: To make me feel special
[2024-06-06, 9:02:23 AM] Zoe: How do you deserve this?
[2024-06-06, 9:02:34 AM] Adam: Hmm do you want a 5000 word essay on that ?
[2024-06-06, 9:02:49 AM] Adam: I deserve it because I am flying 5000 miles to see you ;)
[2024-06-06, 9:03:47 AM] Zoe: That’s not fair
[2024-06-06, 9:03:52 AM] Zoe: You’re not coming to see me
[2024-06-06, 9:03:57 AM] Zoe: You have your brothers
[2024-06-06, 9:04:01 AM] Zoe: And business to attend to
[2024-06-06, 9:04:04 AM] Adam: Definitely coming to see you
[2024-06-06, 9:04:08 AM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-06, 9:04:13 AM] Adam: I think that's a good reason
[2024-06-06, 9:04:25 AM] Adam: How else do I deserve it hmmm
[2024-06-06, 9:04:26 AM] Zoe: You’re not coming to see me
[2024-06-06, 9:04:39 AM] Adam: I am coming to see you otherwise I'd come at a later date
[2024-06-06, 9:04:49 AM] Zoe: Then come at a later date
[2024-06-06, 9:04:58 AM] Zoe: I can’t be what you want
[2024-06-06, 9:05:00 AM] Adam: I'm also not going to urge to come to your apartment...
[2024-06-06, 9:05:05 AM] Adam: Not gonna be so pushy
[2024-06-06, 9:05:07 AM] Adam: ;)
[2024-06-06, 9:05:20 AM] Adam: I pledge an oath to be sweet and kind
[2024-06-06, 9:05:32 AM] Zoe: Come at a later date
[2024-06-06, 9:05:40 AM] Zoe: You’re going to be disappointed
[2024-06-06, 9:06:13 AM] Adam: I think that's deserving
[2024-06-06, 9:06:22 AM] Adam: I just wanna see em like peekaboo

[2024-06-06, 9:14:18 AM] Adam: A look doesn't hurt
[2024-06-06, 9:14:30 AM] Adam: Lucky I ain't squeezing 😍
[2024-06-06, 9:14:32 AM] Zoe: I don’t wanna show

[2024-06-06, 9:15:35 AM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-06, 9:15:37 AM] Adam: So is that a yes 😍
[2024-06-06, 9:15:49 AM] Zoe: So I likely won’t see you till mid week right?
[2024-06-06, 9:15:57 AM] Adam: Whenever you have a chance I guess
[2024-06-06, 9:16:02 AM] Zoe: Ok

[2024-06-06, 9:52:14 AM] Zoe: Oh?
[2024-06-06, 9:52:17 AM] Zoe: What is it
[2024-06-06, 9:54:16 AM] Zoe: You said tea before?
[2024-06-06, 9:58:04 AM] Adam: It's a gift
[2024-06-06, 9:58:09 AM] Adam: So what do you say now
[2024-06-06, 10:03:30 AM] Zoe: Hm?
[2024-06-06, 10:04:08 AM] Zoe: You know when I was younger I was more willing to be bribed… I didn’t even have a proper job till I was 30
[2024-06-06, 10:04:31 AM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-06, 10:04:34 AM] Adam: It ain't a bribe
[2024-06-06, 10:04:37 AM] Zoe: That used to be your major complaint with me… that I was going nowhere with no job, living at home
[2024-06-06, 10:04:54 AM] Adam: It's more of a gift exchange 😄
[2024-06-06, 10:06:14 AM] Adam: It's a look but no touching sort of thing
[2024-06-06, 10:06:25 AM] Adam: Like a painting
[2024-06-06, 10:06:34 AM] Zoe: You’re strange
[2024-06-06, 10:06:38 AM] Adam: Hahaha
[2024-06-06, 10:06:39 AM] Adam: Why
[2024-06-06, 10:07:00 AM] Zoe: The only thing you talk about
[2024-06-06, 10:07:05 AM] Adam: Hahahaha
[2024-06-06, 10:07:09 AM] Zoe: You must get off from even talking about it
[2024-06-06, 10:07:16 AM] Adam: I wish
[2024-06-06, 10:07:21 AM] Zoe: Do you?
[2024-06-06, 10:07:30 AM] Adam: Do I wish ? Yes
[2024-06-06, 10:07:39 AM] Zoe: Why?
[2024-06-06, 10:07:45 AM] Adam: I think if you say yes I get super excited and can't wait
[2024-06-06, 10:07:47 AM] Zoe: Would be an uncomfortable existence
[2024-06-06, 10:08:03 AM] Adam: Like I actually build up anticipation
[2024-06-06, 10:08:14 AM] Zoe: Will I be old and fat and you still want it?
[2024-06-06, 10:08:28 AM] Zoe: Or it’s just now while I’m in my 30s
[2024-06-06, 10:08:28 AM] Adam: Yea why not
[2024-06-06, 10:08:43 AM] Adam: Right now is prime time

[2024-06-06, 10:09:03 AM] Adam: Pleeeeeeaase

[2024-06-06, 10:15:34 AM] Adam: Is that a potentially maybe ?
[2024-06-06, 10:15:42 AM] Zoe: Nope
[2024-06-06, 10:15:51 AM] Adam: 🥺
[2024-06-06, 10:15:56 AM] Adam: Not even a slight possibility
[2024-06-06, 10:15:58 AM] Zoe: Sorry
[2024-06-06, 10:16:10 AM] Adam: Like a "I'll think about it"
[2024-06-06, 10:16:13 AM] Zoe: So you don’t want to see me anymore?
[2024-06-06, 10:16:18 AM] Zoe: Nah
[2024-06-06, 10:16:31 AM] Adam: What about a kiss on the cheek
[2024-06-06, 10:16:41 AM] Zoe: From who to who
[2024-06-06, 10:16:53 AM] Adam: Me to you
[2024-06-06, 10:17:05 AM] Zoe: I dunno
[2024-06-06, 10:19:49 AM] Adam: You out here rejecting it all
[2024-06-06, 10:20:21 AM] Zoe: Might be because you’re expecting
[2024-06-06, 10:20:28 AM] Zoe: I dunno why you expect anything
[2024-06-06, 10:20:49 AM] Adam: Gets me excited :)
[2024-06-06, 10:21:10 AM] Adam: Like super super excited 😊

[2024-06-06, 10:21:49 AM] Zoe: That’s a keto wrap
[2024-06-06, 10:21:54 AM] Zoe: video omitted
[2024-06-06, 10:22:08 AM] Adam: See I'd trade that
[2024-06-06, 10:22:10 AM] Adam: For a quick peak
[2024-06-06, 10:22:13 AM] Adam: 😄
[2024-06-06, 10:23:10 AM] Zoe: Trade that?
[2024-06-06, 10:23:23 AM] Zoe: You mean try
[2024-06-06, 10:23:27 AM] Zoe: It wasn’t halal
[2024-06-06, 10:23:41 AM] Zoe: You eat non halal now?
[2024-06-06, 10:24:11 AM] Adam: Trade, try whatever it is
[2024-06-06, 10:24:38 AM] Adam: I think I deserve it 😁
[2024-06-06, 10:24:44 AM] Zoe: You’re nuts
[2024-06-06, 10:26:12 AM] Adam: Looking is not the same as touching
[2024-06-06, 10:26:20 AM] Adam: I mean I deserve a look at least
[2024-06-06, 10:26:24 AM] Zoe: Look at porn
[2024-06-06, 10:26:26 AM] Zoe: Deserve?
[2024-06-06, 10:26:30 AM] Zoe: Wtf is going on
[2024-06-06, 10:26:36 AM] Adam: GIF omitted
[2024-06-06, 10:26:36 AM] Zoe: You want me to block you don’t you

[2024-06-06, 10:42:30 AM] Adam: Lol ?
[2024-06-06, 10:42:40 AM] Adam: Why ?
[2024-06-06, 10:43:05 AM] Zoe: Cause you’re testing my patience
[2024-06-06, 10:52:17 AM] Adam: If I wanted you to block me I wouldn't respond....
[2024-06-06, 10:52:20 AM] Adam: It's that easy lol..
[2024-06-06, 10:52:28 AM] Adam: Good

[2024-06-06, 11:02:23 AM] Adam: Why what ?
[2024-06-06, 11:10:42 AM] Zoe: Why is it good?

[2024-06-06, 4:07:49 PM] Adam: Don't really care

[2024-06-06, 8:24:28 PM] Adam: But it's completely full
[2024-06-06, 8:24:44 PM] Zoe: Aw shoot that’s gunna be uncomfortable
[2024-06-06, 8:24:53 PM] Zoe: You gotta move around then
[2024-06-06, 8:24:58 PM] Adam: Meh
[2024-06-06, 8:24:59 PM] Adam: I've been flying a lot anyway
[2024-06-06, 8:25:09 PM] Zoe: I’ve never been on a flight longer than 6 hours
[2024-06-06, 8:25:37 PM] Adam: It's not bad
[2024-06-06, 8:25:49 PM] Adam: If you got a window seat you can pretty much sleep the entire way
[2024-06-06, 8:26:12 PM] Zoe: I’d be scared of blood clots
[2024-06-06, 8:26:33 PM] Zoe: Guess it doesn’t happen often
[2024-06-06, 8:26:39 PM] Adam: That doesn't happen after 13 hrs lol
[2024-06-06, 8:26:44 PM] Adam: Maybe 20+
[2024-06-07, 8:18:33 AM] Adam: So when do you wanna see me
[2024-06-07, 8:18:47 AM] Zoe: Are you in Ottawa?
[2024-06-07, 8:19:01 AM] Adam: Lol no still on the plane
[2024-06-07, 8:19:06 AM] Zoe: Oh
[2024-06-07, 8:19:23 AM] Zoe: I dunno… it has to be covertly like you said
[2024-06-07, 8:19:39 AM] Adam: What about Saturday night ?
[2024-06-07, 8:19:54 AM] Zoe: I’m seeing Chris Saturday
[2024-06-07, 8:20:00 AM] Adam: All night ?
[2024-06-07, 8:20:04 AM] Zoe: Not sure
[2024-06-07, 8:20:16 AM] Zoe: He hasn’t slept over for months
[2024-06-07, 8:20:16 AM] Adam: It actually works out this way
[2024-06-07, 8:20:21 AM] Adam: Since you won't have to lie
[2024-06-07, 8:20:23 AM] Zoe: How?
[2024-06-07, 8:20:26 AM] Adam: You won't even have to mention it
[2024-06-07, 8:20:35 AM] Adam: Since you hung out with him on that day
[2024-06-07, 8:20:37 AM] Zoe: Here’s the thing he is already suspicious
[2024-06-07, 8:20:42 AM] Adam: How so ?
[2024-06-07, 8:20:51 AM] Zoe: I didn’t sleep with him when I saw him
[2024-06-07, 8:21:04 AM] Adam: Why would that be suspicious
[2024-06-07, 8:21:11 AM] Adam: You have a perfectly good reason...
[2024-06-07, 8:21:18 AM] Zoe: And he kept saying I seem distant and cold and if asked if I was seeing someone
[2024-06-07, 8:21:39 AM] Adam: You say no and you tell him
[2024-06-07, 8:21:45 AM] Adam: This is what happens when we see each other once a week
[2024-06-07, 8:21:51 AM] Adam: Simple
[2024-06-07, 8:22:00 AM] Zoe: But then he will say “I will see you more”
[2024-06-07, 8:22:05 AM] Adam: Sure ?
[2024-06-07, 8:22:12 AM] Adam: I doubt he's down for that
[2024-06-07, 8:22:14 AM] Zoe: Cause technically I will have seen him 2 times this week

[2024-06-09, 8:31:21 AM] Zoe: I mean to meet up with you after having sex with him
[2024-06-09, 8:31:30 AM] Adam: You didn't want sex
[2024-06-09, 8:31:34 AM] Adam: That's all that matters.

[2024-06-09, 8:31:43 AM] Zoe: No not all
[2024-06-09, 8:31:58 AM] Adam: What happened doesn't matter and it doesn't hurt me at all

[2024-06-09, 8:33:11 AM] Adam: It makes sense think about it
[2024-06-09, 8:33:14 AM] Adam: Someone doesn't want to have sex
[2024-06-09, 8:33:29 AM] Adam: If you come here and said you did
[2024-06-09, 8:33:33 AM] Adam: And enjoyed every bit of it
[2024-06-09, 8:33:42 AM] Adam: That would upset me but not much I can do

[2024-06-09, 8:40:54 AM] Zoe: I wasn’t going to have you come in
[2024-06-09, 8:41:01 AM] Zoe: You didn’t invite me to one of your places
[2024-06-09, 8:41:05 AM] Zoe: Not one
[2024-06-09, 8:41:11 AM] Adam: But that wasn't as easy as this ..
[2024-06-09, 8:41:23 AM] Zoe: The apartment, your basement thing, your basement at your parents
[2024-06-09, 8:41:33 AM] Adam: I told you for a long time the guys all used to be at my place
[2024-06-09, 8:41:36 AM] Adam: Constantly using it
[2024-06-09, 8:41:39 AM] Zoe: It being easier isn’t a good excuse
[2024-06-09, 8:41:54 AM] Zoe: Not good enough excuse
[2024-06-09, 8:41:58 AM] Zoe: Sorry
[2024-06-09, 8:42:06 AM] Adam: But payback isn't a good excuse
[2024-06-09, 8:42:13 AM] Adam: It's just vengeance lol
[2024-06-09, 8:42:17 AM] Zoe: It’s not payback it’s boundaries
[2024-06-09, 8:42:17 AM] Adam: It's revenge..
[2024-06-09, 8:42:23 AM] Adam: It's not boundaries
[2024-06-09, 8:42:36 AM] Adam: This is payback lol..
[2024-06-09, 8:42:52 AM] Adam: Look I sincerely apologize for not making it a priority or not kicking out the guys
[2024-06-09, 8:42:59 AM] Adam: But I promise it wasn't as easy as you walking in..
[2024-06-09, 8:43:11 AM] Adam: And I wish it was..the guys always had the keys
[2024-06-09, 8:43:18 AM] Adam: They would always smoke and chill and eat there
[2024-06-09, 8:43:38 AM] Adam: I should have done more to make it happen but I guess I didn't want them knowing anything
[2024-06-09, 8:46:33 AM] Zoe: Too late for apologies
[2024-06-09, 8:46:43 AM] Zoe: Too late for everything
[2024-06-09, 8:46:54 AM] Adam: No that's how you choose to see..
[2024-06-09, 8:46:58 AM] Zoe: I never had any priority
[2024-06-09, 8:47:01 AM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-09, 8:47:06 AM] Zoe: Anyways
[2024-06-09, 8:47:08 AM] Adam: If you actually stop for a second and think is it my emotions
[2024-06-09, 8:47:12 AM] Zoe: This isn’t pleasant
[2024-06-09, 8:47:47 AM] Adam: That's the driving force behind this thing.. you'll realize your mind is adding more weight to it than it actually is..
[2024-06-09, 8:48:19 AM] Adam: It's never too late, so long as time is a factor and enables new opportunities, too late is a mental construct..
[2024-06-09, 8:48:50 AM] Adam: Second, the entire purpose behind apologies is that they happen after the fact..you can't apologize for something that hasn't happened..
[2024-06-09, 8:49:08 AM] Adam: So there's zero logic behind apologies being too late...
[2024-06-09, 8:49:42 AM] Zoe: Fine apology
[2024-06-09, 8:49:52 AM] Zoe: Apologize
[2024-06-09, 8:50:00 AM] Zoe: Thanks but
[2024-06-09, 8:50:10 AM] Adam: I told you, I am genuinely sorry I should have done more to make it a priority..
[2024-06-09, 8:50:18 AM] Zoe: Doesn’t help for me
[2024-06-09, 8:50:26 AM] Adam: I did always choose friends over anything and that was wrong..
[2024-06-09, 8:50:39 AM] Adam: I was always afraid or worried about upsetting them.
[2024-06-09, 8:50:50 AM] Zoe: Sad
[2024-06-09, 8:50:53 AM] Adam: But I realized long ago, that sometimes we please the wrong people
[2024-06-09, 8:51:03 AM] Adam: Not because they demand it
[2024-06-09, 8:51:16 AM] Adam: Or because you deem them more worthy
[2024-06-09, 8:51:22 AM] Adam: But it's probably insecurities..
[2024-06-09, 8:51:33 AM] Zoe: But also selfishness
[2024-06-09, 8:51:43 AM] Zoe: Your insecurities
[2024-06-09, 8:51:45 AM] Adam: In my pack, if you choose a girl over your guys it was considered weak
[2024-06-09, 8:51:51 AM] Adam: It wasn't selfishness..
[2024-06-09, 8:51:55 AM] Zoe: It is
[2024-06-09, 8:51:56 AM] Adam: It was pure insecurity
[2024-06-09, 8:52:14 AM] Zoe: Insecurity is also selfish, you refused to see I was hurting
[2024-06-09, 8:52:19 AM] Adam: I always wanted to have you over..I just didn't have the courage to tell them to leave or I need the place..
[2024-06-09, 8:52:31 AM] Adam: Because I was worried how they would see me..
[2024-06-09, 8:52:31 AM] Zoe: Oh well
[2024-06-09, 8:52:49 AM] Adam: The pack that I'm in tends to make you feel weak when you display any form of emotions.
[2024-06-09, 8:52:59 AM] Zoe: lol?
[2024-06-09, 8:53:19 AM] Adam: Yea it was the way I was raised I guess and that became the people I was always around
[2024-06-09, 8:53:22 AM] Adam: The dynamics..
[2024-06-09, 8:53:50 AM] Adam: And trust me, I am not realizing that now because I want to come over..it's not a script I am reading off of to serve my purpose...it's what I have come to realize when I left Canada..
[2024-06-09, 8:54:38 AM] Adam: So much of our life is driven by these rules and laws that are non-existent...they are all a mental construct that inhibits us being our true self..
[2024-06-09, 8:55:26 AM] Adam: Even resentment or this longing feeling of someone wronging you inhibits you as well.
[2024-06-09, 8:55:54 AM] Adam: You become a slave to a thought and hinders you from reality playing out
[2024-06-09, 8:56:11 AM] Zoe: I entered a relationship
[2024-06-09, 8:56:15 AM] Zoe: Found peace there
[2024-06-09, 8:56:18 AM] Zoe: Kind of
[2024-06-09, 8:56:26 AM] Zoe: But continued to hang on to an ex
[2024-06-09, 8:56:36 AM] Adam: Ok beyond what your mind thinks of that ...
[2024-06-09, 8:56:37 AM] Zoe: It’s not all resentment towards you
[2024-06-09, 8:56:45 AM] Adam: What is the true issue?
[2024-06-09, 8:57:14 AM] Zoe: Time to sleep or get up for me
[2024-06-09, 8:57:18 AM] Adam: All of how you feel about that is based on a set of data within your memory that inhibits you..
[2024-06-09, 8:57:59 AM] Adam: The experience is the reality not how we feel or think... because it's so easy to swing back and forth with emotions
[2024-06-09, 9:00:28 AM] Adam: Will you let me come over ❤️
[2024-06-09, 9:00:46 AM] Adam: It's cold and wet outside, I promise to behave
[2024-06-09, 9:02:24 AM] Zoe: I can’t invite you over sorry
[2024-06-09, 9:02:34 AM] Zoe: Won’t
[2024-06-09, 9:02:38 AM] Adam: Can we talk about it outside your place
[2024-06-09, 9:02:43 AM] Adam: I'll come with my car
[2024-06-09, 9:02:50 AM] Zoe: You won’t get in
[2024-06-09, 9:02:54 AM] Zoe: I guarantee
[2024-06-09, 9:02:58 AM] Adam: I don't want to get in because I want to.
[2024-06-09, 9:03:06 AM] Adam: I want to talk about it and reach that conclusion together
[2024-06-09, 9:03:09 AM] Zoe: I get it, it’s rainy
[2024-06-09, 9:03:24 AM] Zoe: You want to change my mind
[2024-06-09, 9:03:37 AM] Adam: No I want to truly have you understand
[2024-06-09, 9:03:37 AM] Zoe: Wanna go to church????
[2024-06-09, 9:03:40 AM] Adam: And believe what I am saying
[2024-06-09, 9:03:56 AM] Adam: I know you don't yet but I want to at least try to make you understand and see
[2024-06-09, 9:04:58 AM] Zoe: Seeeeee
[2024-06-09, 9:05:21 AM] Adam: If I can rewind believe me I'd do a lot for things differently.
[2024-06-09, 9:05:31 AM] Adam: But I don't have that pleasure...I only have the now to work with ..
[2024-06-09, 9:05:33 AM] Zoe: Look I would be more agreeable if I felt single
[2024-06-09, 9:05:38 AM] Zoe: But now I don’t again
[2024-06-09, 9:05:47 AM] Adam: Ok let's unpack that for a second..
[2024-06-09, 9:06:37 AM] Adam: You used the word "felt" which is very different if you said "If I was single"...a feeling isn't the source of truth..

You've allowed your thoughts to define the truth when the reality is very different..
[2024-06-09, 9:06:48 AM] Adam: You did not want to have sex again...you wanted him to own up and change..
[2024-06-09, 9:07:06 AM] Adam: Having sex doesn't make you in a relationship, especially if you are saying you did not want it..
[2024-06-09, 9:07:15 AM] Adam: If you wanted it, this whole situation would be so different..
[2024-06-09, 9:07:29 AM] Adam: Then it wouldn't be a feeling...you wouldn't feel in a relationship...you would be in one..
[2024-06-09, 9:07:44 AM] Zoe: Sure but I also still have feelings for him
[2024-06-09, 9:07:46 AM] Adam: Don't allow that slip of conscious to determine everything.
[2024-06-09, 9:07:51 AM] Zoe: And he doesn’t know you’re here
[2024-06-09, 9:07:55 AM] Zoe: It’s awkward
[2024-06-09, 9:07:59 AM] Adam: Ok but you have feelings for me..does it mean you and I are in a relationship?
[2024-06-09, 9:08:14 AM] Zoe: No but I was most recently with him
[2024-06-09, 9:08:20 AM] Adam: There's no merit there.. it's all just thoughts and feelings that hold no validity..
[2024-06-09, 9:08:22 AM] Zoe: And I don’t think I could go back
[2024-06-09, 9:08:28 AM] Zoe: After anything with you
[2024-06-09, 9:08:29 AM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-09, 9:08:31 AM] Adam: Again is that objective ? Or is that subjective...
[2024-06-09, 9:08:33 AM] Zoe: I’m certain
[2024-06-09, 9:11:13 AM] Adam: I've always said this..you've given too much control to your mind whose operating system runs on thoughts, emotions and feelings that have an expiry date as little as a few minutrs..
[2024-06-09, 9:11:36 AM] Adam: You are far more in control than you think..these are self-inserted limitations that you're putting..
[2024-06-09, 9:12:36 AM] Adam: What am I trying to get you to see ? My side of things ? Absolutely not, I have always said that objectivity doesn't care about feelings and thoughts..
[2024-06-09, 9:12:51 AM] Adam: It holds value because of the fact that it disregards these fleeing variables..
[2024-06-09, 9:13:37 AM] Adam: You are not any less single than you were last week..you had sex despite not wanting to..
[2024-06-09, 9:13:55 AM] Adam: It wasn't love that drove you to having sex...you felt pressured because you believed he was suspicious..
[2024-06-09, 9:14:33 AM] Zoe: We can meet up outside somewhere
[2024-06-09, 9:14:39 AM] Zoe: I can take my moms car
[2024-06-09, 9:14:45 AM] Zoe: We can meet up
[2024-06-09, 9:14:45 AM] Adam: I want to talk about inside..
[2024-06-09, 9:14:53 AM] Adam: I promise I won't try anything.
[2024-06-09, 9:15:00 AM] Adam: I won't pressure or be pushy.
[2024-06-09, 9:15:10 AM] Zoe: You will be pushy I know you
[2024-06-09, 9:15:18 AM] Zoe: Why not try it this was today
[2024-06-09, 9:15:21 AM] Adam: I promise not to be
[2024-06-09, 9:15:23 AM] Adam: And if I am
[2024-06-09, 9:15:27 AM] Adam: Kick me out right away
[2024-06-09, 9:15:28 AM] Zoe: So at least we can meet up
[2024-06-09, 9:15:33 AM] Adam: But I am trying to be different.
[2024-06-09, 9:15:34 AM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-09, 9:15:37 AM] Adam: I am trying to show you I am different
[2024-06-09, 9:15:46 AM] Adam: It would be a disservice to my self
[2024-06-09, 9:15:51 AM] Adam: If I tried anything or was pushy
[2024-06-09, 9:16:02 AM] Adam: And you can take it as a fact that I haven't changed at all if that were the case
[2024-06-09, 9:16:13 AM] Adam: And all that I am is a fuck boy
[2024-06-09, 9:16:38 AM] Adam: Believe me the only way I can demonstrate change is I am given the opportunity to show you that I am different..
[2024-06-09, 9:16:50 AM] Adam: Typically I would be pushy and try to get into your pants
[2024-06-09, 9:16:58 AM] Adam: But you will see that won't be the case and I'll behave
[2024-06-09, 9:18:08 AM] Zoe: I don’t want to invite you in
[2024-06-09, 9:18:21 AM] Zoe: It won’t ve pleasant for you
[2024-06-09, 9:18:30 AM] Zoe: Outside
[2024-06-09, 9:18:30 AM] Adam: Why not
[2024-06-09, 9:18:33 AM] Adam: Explain
[2024-06-09, 9:18:36 AM] Zoe: It’s cold
[2024-06-09, 9:18:38 AM] Zoe: And we’re
[2024-06-09, 9:18:39 AM] Adam: I want to understand
[2024-06-09, 9:18:40 AM] Zoe: Wet
[2024-06-09, 9:18:52 AM] Zoe: And you won’t get what you want
[2024-06-09, 9:18:58 AM] Zoe: I’m keeping that boundary
[2024-06-09, 9:19:15 AM] Adam: One second
[2024-06-09, 9:19:15 AM] Zoe: I’d like to meet
[2024-06-09, 9:19:21 AM] Zoe: But just casually
[2024-06-09, 9:19:25 AM] Zoe: If you’re down
[2024-06-09, 9:21:40 AM] Adam: I am telling you that I need to demonstrate that I am not after that..I need to prove to myself and to you...
[2024-06-09, 9:22:16 AM] Zoe: Then let’s meet up casually gee
[2024-06-09, 9:22:44 AM] Adam: I'm only saying your place because it's the comfort of a home..we can talk, watch something..you can make me tea 😂
[2024-06-09, 9:23:02 AM] Adam: Nothing will happen you will see..I won't be pushy and I'll be on my best behavior
[2024-06-09, 9:23:23 AM] Zoe: Not the day after I have sex
[2024-06-09, 9:23:25 AM] Zoe: Sorry
[2024-06-09, 9:23:37 AM] Adam: But you didn't want to have sex...
[2024-06-09, 9:23:40 AM] Adam: You had zero intention..
[2024-06-09, 9:23:42 AM] Zoe: Doesn’t matter
[2024-06-09, 9:23:45 AM] Zoe: I reset
[2024-06-09, 9:23:48 AM] Adam: Why can't you lean on that ?
[2024-06-09, 9:23:50 AM] Zoe: The pendulum
[2024-06-09, 9:24:03 AM] Adam: How does it not matter? It matters entirely..sex isn't the defining factor it's how you feel..
[2024-06-09, 9:24:20 AM] Adam: You didn't want to have sex and if I ask you now if you can reverse it, would you ?
[2024-06-09, 9:24:41 AM] Adam: That's far more telling than him stroking once and finishing lol..
[2024-06-09, 9:25:28 AM] Adam: You know how I know this is all in your head? Because placement doesn't matter if you truly loved him and wanted to have sex..you wouldn't meet me outside, inside or anywhere else..
[2024-06-09, 9:25:45 AM] Adam: You're setting limitations to rationalize having sex but it's much easier to just accept it for what it is..
[2024-06-09, 9:25:53 AM] Adam: Something you did not want at all..so there is no rreset.
[2024-06-09, 9:28:21 AM] Zoe: Ah but I do like him, and that is why I’m hesitant to meet up with you
[2024-06-09, 9:28:43 AM] Zoe: I wish I didn’t like him and we could meet up and celebrate you being back in Ottawa
[2024-06-09, 9:28:47 AM] Zoe: But it’s not like that
[2024-06-09, 9:29:02 AM] Adam: I didn't say you don't like him..of course you do..
[2024-06-09, 9:29:45 AM] Adam: But the feelings have been reserved for quite some time because of ongoing issues..
[2024-06-09, 9:30:35 AM] Adam: Here's one way to look at it..does sex dissolve your issues ? Can someone argue that by having sex it means you two have forgave each other and you're both now on the same path ?
[2024-06-09, 9:30:48 AM] Adam: No you couldn't because you can argue that you didn't want it...that decision holds merit..
[2024-06-09, 9:31:20 AM] Zoe: I understand this
[2024-06-09, 9:31:30 AM] Zoe: But doesn’t mean I should run off with you
[2024-06-09, 9:31:33 AM] Adam: You are reading it but you're not understanding it.
[2024-06-09, 9:31:37 AM] Zoe: And let you please me
[2024-06-09, 9:31:41 AM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-09, 9:31:43 AM] Adam: Ok now who said run off with me?
[2024-06-09, 9:31:56 AM] Adam: I was just teasing...I wouldn't do that and wouldn't put you in that position.
[2024-06-09, 9:31:58 AM] Zoe: lol run off , as in meet up
[2024-06-09, 9:32:12 AM] Adam: Yea but recognize how you have labelled it..
[2024-06-09, 9:32:14 AM] Zoe: Let’s just casually meet up
[2024-06-09, 9:32:34 AM] Adam: Your use of the word run off tells me that, in your mind, you have added far more weight to it than actuality.. <This message was edited>
[2024-06-09, 9:33:08 AM] Adam: You see it as figuratively running off, which is so far from the truth..
[2024-06-09, 9:33:27 AM] Adam: It's like inviting a friend over for tea..despite being an ex..it's as simple as that.
[2024-06-09, 9:34:04 AM] Adam: Mark my words you can adopt that state of mind in less than 20 minutes and when we meet up you probably will..
[2024-06-09, 9:34:22 AM] Adam: It's a telling sign that your thoughts inhibit you and give them permission to define reality..
[2024-06-09, 9:34:32 AM] Adam: You'll see how they'll flee..
[2024-06-09, 9:36:29 AM] Zoe: I’m not inviting you over
[2024-06-09, 9:37:29 AM] Adam: WHYYYYY
[2024-06-09, 9:37:32 AM] Adam: Explain lol
[2024-06-09, 9:37:38 AM] Adam: I am just dying to hear some logic
[2024-06-09, 9:37:46 AM] Zoe: Lolll
[2024-06-09, 9:37:58 AM] Adam: Please lol
[2024-06-09, 9:38:05 AM] Adam: That's how my mind works
[2024-06-09, 9:38:09 AM] Adam: It submits to logic
[2024-06-09, 9:39:16 AM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-09, 9:39:28 AM] Zoe: I’ll see if I can use ChatGPT
[2024-06-09, 9:42:54 AM] Zoe: I understand you may not see my reasons as logical, but my comfort and boundaries are important to me. Let's find a neutral location for now, and we can discuss meeting at my place later when we both feel more comfortable.
[2024-06-09, 10:07:32 AM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-09, 10:07:36 AM] Adam: That reason is asssssss
[2024-06-09, 10:07:45 AM] Adam: I need a better one
[2024-06-09, 10:13:44 AM] Adam: I'm coming over soon
[2024-06-09, 10:13:57 AM] Zoe: Waaaaht
[2024-06-09, 10:14:13 AM] Adam: Yes ma'am
[2024-06-09, 10:14:35 AM] Zoe: No sir
[2024-06-09, 10:14:56 AM] Adam: Yesss
[2024-06-09, 10:15:02 AM] Adam: I'm gonna be on my best behavior
[2024-06-09, 10:48:13 AM] Zoe: Are you really coming?
[2024-06-09, 10:48:55 AM] Zoe: Where r u
[2024-06-09, 10:52:07 AM] Adam: Yea
[2024-06-09, 10:52:11 AM] Adam: Just getting dressed
[2024-06-09, 10:52:23 AM] Adam: I'm coming over right?
[2024-06-09, 10:52:33 AM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-09, 10:52:39 AM] Adam: Whaaaaat
[2024-06-09, 10:52:43 AM] Adam: We just spoke about it for an hour lol
[2024-06-09, 10:52:46 AM] Adam: Please 🥺
[2024-06-09, 10:52:53 AM] Adam: Pretty please
[2024-06-09, 10:52:55 AM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-09, 10:52:58 AM] Adam: Why not...
[2024-06-09, 10:53:00 AM] Zoe: You want to meet
[2024-06-09, 10:53:05 AM] Adam: We talked about it for a long time
[2024-06-09, 10:53:07 AM] Zoe: We can meet somewhere else
[2024-06-09, 10:53:11 AM] Zoe: Duh that was painful
[2024-06-09, 10:53:20 AM] Zoe: Ok I understand no meeting
[2024-06-09, 11:22:46 AM] Zoe: I’m annoyed at you
[2024-06-09, 11:23:01 AM] Zoe: You talked to me for an hour
[2024-06-09, 11:23:07 AM] Zoe: To meet up
[2024-06-09, 11:23:25 AM] Zoe: Then you disappear lol
[2024-06-09, 11:23:33 AM] Zoe: So lame
[2024-06-09, 11:55:44 AM] Adam: Sorry
[2024-06-09, 11:55:47 AM] Adam: Someone called me
[2024-06-09, 11:55:52 AM] Adam: Literally just got off the phone
[2024-06-09, 11:55:55 AM] Adam: Was on the phone for 1 hour
[2024-06-09, 11:56:08 AM] Adam: Couldn't even switch to WhatsApp mid call.

[2024-06-09, 11:59:17 AM] Adam: So I can come over ?
[2024-06-09, 11:59:28 AM] Adam: I hate being outside :(
[2024-06-09, 11:59:31 AM] Adam: I want to be indoors
[2024-06-09, 11:59:42 AM] Zoe: I don’t want to be indoors
[2024-06-09, 11:59:56 AM] Adam: Just this once ❤️
[2024-06-09, 12:00:06 PM] Zoe: No let’s take a walk
[2024-06-09, 12:00:15 PM] Zoe: Stop talking about the possibility
[2024-06-09, 12:00:30 PM] Adam: The weather isn't good
[2024-06-09, 12:00:35 PM] Zoe: Ok sure
[2024-06-09, 12:00:38 PM] Adam: I just want to sit inside and talk lol
[2024-06-09, 12:00:39 PM] Zoe: No hang out then
[2024-06-09, 12:00:43 PM] Adam: Why ???
[2024-06-09, 12:00:44 PM] Zoe: I don’t want to
[2024-06-09, 12:00:54 PM] Adam: What's the issue ? You think something is gonna happen ?
[2024-06-09, 12:02:34 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-09, 12:02:39 PM] Zoe: I just don’t want to
[2024-06-09, 12:06:57 PM] Adam: So tell me what is the reason ?
[2024-06-09, 12:07:17 PM] Zoe: lol read back gave you a million reasons
[2024-06-09, 12:07:35 PM] Zoe: The fact that you won’t meet without coming to my house is another new reason
[2024-06-09, 12:07:36 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-09, 12:12:25 PM] Adam: That's a horribly wrong assumption..
[2024-06-09, 12:12:43 PM] Adam: I just feel upset given that we spent the morning talking about it and I felt like I was making a lot of sense and giving a lot of reassurance..
[2024-06-09, 12:12:58 PM] Adam: And it just feels like you completely disregarded that and didn't even take it into account..
[2024-06-09, 12:13:35 PM] Zoe: I guess we don’t see eye to eye
[2024-06-09, 12:13:56 PM] Adam: And I tried really hard time understand
[2024-06-09, 12:14:11 PM] Adam: But you weren't making sense you even used GPT to try and explain it
[2024-06-09, 12:14:30 PM] Adam: At the core of it I am upset that you aren't willing to forgive
[2024-06-09, 12:14:49 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-09, 12:15:43 PM] Adam: There's also thunderstorms
[2024-06-09, 12:16:02 PM] Adam: I really want to see you I just don't want to be wet or thinking of a spot and I don't want to be in the car
[2024-06-09, 12:16:11 PM] Adam: I just want it to be casual, drink some tea whatever and talk
[2024-06-09, 12:17:08 PM] Zoe: You don’t need to think of a place I know a place
[2024-06-09, 12:17:16 PM] Zoe: image omitted
[2024-06-09, 12:17:34 PM] Zoe: Also all these people wouldn’t agree with your rain forecast
[2024-06-09, 12:17:52 PM] Adam: So you're not at home...

[2024-06-09, 12:19:22 PM] Adam: I just don't see why we can't be adults and just hangout at home and drink tea..
[2024-06-09, 12:19:24 PM] Zoe: Or stop
[2024-06-09, 12:19:28 PM] Adam: Like adults lol
[2024-06-09, 12:19:32 PM] Zoe: Let’s go to a tea shop
[2024-06-09, 12:19:40 PM] Zoe: Be an adult and accept my answer
[2024-06-09, 12:19:55 PM] Adam: I would if you didn't give reasons that I spent a long time considering and answering..
[2024-06-09, 12:20:06 PM] Adam: It's not nice when you shut me down like that..
[2024-06-09, 12:21:55 PM] Zoe: Ok

[2024-06-10, 8:36:11 AM] Adam: He gets sex
[2024-06-10, 8:36:12 AM] Zoe: But why would I want to do the same thing
[2024-06-10, 8:36:19 AM] Adam: And he only comes once a week
[2024-06-10, 8:36:41 AM] Zoe: He’s coming today… and frankly he wants to come more often.. he’s planned something for this week

[2024-06-10, 8:37:22 AM] Adam: That's what he wants
[2024-06-10, 8:38:03 AM] Adam: Also what we have is very very very different than say if you were doing this with some random guy
[2024-06-10, 8:38:20 AM] Adam: We've been on and off for a decade and we always have stayed in touch
[2024-06-10, 8:43:32 AM] Zoe: There is no point in being sexual with you. It does nothing for me
[2024-06-10, 8:43:55 AM] Zoe: I don’t get anything from these brief “passions”
[2024-06-10, 8:44:20 AM] Zoe: Can I say something to get you to leave me alone?

[2024-06-10, 9:14:43 AM] Adam: Don't want to ruin that for you
[2024-06-10, 9:14:49 AM] Adam: Something less
[2024-06-10, 9:18:46 AM] Zoe: Keep dreaming, now I know to stay away from you
[2024-06-10, 9:18:57 AM] Adam: Why you asked me
[2024-06-10, 9:19:08 AM] Adam: This was the question
[2024-06-10, 9:19:14 AM] Adam: I'm actually giving you a way out
[2024-06-10, 9:19:25 AM] Zoe: Read it from the context of the above question
[2024-06-10, 9:19:30 AM] Zoe: It’s just a continuation

[2024-06-10, 10:03:02 AM] Adam: I don't care
[2024-06-10, 10:03:14 AM] Zoe: I don’t want to be touched though
[2024-06-10, 10:03:27 AM] Zoe: I don’t see a point to you coming
[2024-06-10, 10:03:29 AM] Adam: Ain't gonna happen
[2024-06-10, 10:03:31 AM] Zoe: For 10 minutes
[2024-06-10, 10:03:37 AM] Adam: 30
[2024-06-10, 10:03:45 AM] Zoe: That has to be at lunch then
[2024-06-10, 10:03:53 AM] Zoe: I can’t leave for 30
[2024-06-10, 10:04:13 AM] Adam: Ok why can't you just let me in, you work in your laptop and I stay for 30 mins and leave
[2024-06-10, 10:04:16 AM] Zoe: O
[2024-06-10, 10:04:16 AM] Adam: I misbehave
[2024-06-10, 10:04:18 AM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-10, 10:04:19 AM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-10, 10:04:19 AM] Adam: And you kick me out
[2024-06-10, 10:04:22 AM] Zoe: Nvm
[2024-06-10, 10:04:25 AM] Adam: Simple as that
[2024-06-10, 10:04:29 AM] Zoe: This is just inviting trouble
[2024-06-10, 10:04:31 AM] Zoe: I’m busy
[2024-06-10, 10:04:33 AM] Zoe: Bye
[2024-06-10, 10:04:33 AM] Adam: How ????
[2024-06-10, 10:04:35 AM] Adam: You're working...
[2024-06-10, 10:04:40 AM] Adam: You won't even be near me
[2024-06-10, 10:04:48 AM] Adam: It's literally in your living room
[2024-06-10, 10:04:54 AM] Adam: I'm sitting on the floor and you're working
[2024-06-10, 10:05:02 AM] Adam: I'll bring some breakfast
[2024-06-10, 10:05:03 AM] Adam: And I'll leave
[2024-06-10, 10:05:07 AM] Adam: I won't stay for long at all
[2024-06-10, 10:06:28 AM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-10, 10:07:08 AM] Adam: You're honestly acting like just by stepping inside, we will magically have our clothes torn off and somehow be in bed lol .
[2024-06-10, 10:07:13 AM] Zoe: If you ever want to meet again while here it’s on my terms. It’s outside and it’s in public and during the day.
[2024-06-10, 10:07:27 AM] Adam: It's actually far better for you to be in your own home
[2024-06-10, 10:07:27 AM] Zoe: That’s it, that’s all.
[2024-06-10, 10:07:37 AM] Adam: You don't want me inside, you simply say I'd like for you to leave..
[2024-06-10, 10:07:47 AM] Adam: It's that easy, you don't have to go anywhere or be anywhere
[2024-06-10, 10:08:31 AM] Zoe: No you are not coming in
[2024-06-10, 10:08:35 AM] Zoe: Not a single chance
[2024-06-10, 10:08:47 AM] Adam: Do you really think something will happen lol ?
[2024-06-10, 10:08:48 AM] Zoe: .
[2024-06-10, 10:09:03 AM] Adam: Ah we did meet up during the day
[2024-06-10, 10:09:06 AM] Adam: And it was in public
[2024-06-10, 10:09:13 AM] Adam: You're acting like what happened was 100% on me
[2024-06-10, 10:17:02 AM] Zoe: It’s not 100% you. I have to take accountability
[2024-06-10, 10:17:06 AM] Zoe: And have to stop it too
[2024-06-10, 10:17:15 AM] Zoe: Best if we don’t meet
[2024-06-10, 10:17:16 AM] Zoe: Thanks
[2024-06-10, 10:17:20 AM] Zoe: For understanding
[2024-06-10, 10:17:42 AM] Zoe: .

[2024-06-10, 10:21:26 AM] Adam: Felt like someone gave me an injection of heroin 😂
[2024-06-10, 10:21:38 AM] Zoe: That’s on you bro

[2024-06-10, 10:21:53 AM] Adam: That was not healthy for me
[2024-06-10, 10:22:00 AM] Adam: Now I'm addicted like crack
[2024-06-10, 10:22:19 AM] Adam: Hahahah the middle finger
[2024-06-10, 10:22:23 AM] Zoe: Good realize and stay away
[2024-06-10, 10:22:25 AM] Adam: Look I wish it didn't happen either
[2024-06-10, 10:22:28 AM] Adam: But it did
[2024-06-10, 10:22:32 AM] Zoe: Fuck you
[2024-06-10, 10:22:36 AM] Zoe: I didn’t ask for that
[2024-06-10, 10:22:35 AM] Adam: Why ?
[2024-06-10, 10:22:37 AM] Adam: Why fuck me
[2024-06-10, 10:22:48 AM] Zoe: I asked you to stay on your side
[2024-06-10, 10:22:57 AM] Adam: You were teasing
[2024-06-10, 10:23:00 AM] Adam: You kept teasing
[2024-06-10, 10:23:14 AM] Adam: You also didn't throw me off and you would smile and laugh
[2024-06-10, 10:23:23 AM] Adam: And when I'd stroke my hair you smiled and said
[2024-06-10, 10:23:29 AM] Adam: Do you remember you used to always do that
[2024-06-10, 10:23:33 AM] Adam: So definitely was not all me
[2024-06-10, 10:23:42 AM] Adam: I will admit tho that I initiated
[2024-06-10, 10:25:19 AM] Zoe: I would not have grinded on you
[2024-06-10, 10:25:25 AM] Zoe: And I did not grind on you
[2024-06-10, 10:25:27 AM] Zoe: Please
[2024-06-10, 10:25:32 AM] Zoe: You initiated everything
[2024-06-10, 10:25:33 AM] Adam: Yea I admit it wasn't initiated by you
[2024-06-10, 10:25:37 AM] Adam: I just said that
[2024-06-10, 10:25:38 AM] Zoe: And now I have to live with this
[2024-06-10, 10:25:43 AM] Adam: Oh coman man
[2024-06-10, 10:25:46 AM] Zoe: Dude
[2024-06-10, 10:25:50 AM] Adam: Where was all this when you were having sex with men
[2024-06-10, 10:25:53 AM] Adam: And telling me I love you
[2024-06-10, 10:25:55 AM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-10, 10:25:55 AM] Zoe: You just want to mess with me
[2024-06-10, 10:26:00 AM] Adam: Absolutely not
[2024-06-10, 10:26:04 AM] Adam: This is what you do
[2024-06-10, 10:26:10 AM] Zoe: I never had sex with anyone else for 8 years
[2024-06-10, 10:26:11 AM] Adam: You play victim
[2024-06-10, 10:26:18 AM] Adam: You act like you were so innocent
[2024-06-10, 10:26:21 AM] Adam: And I was at fault
[2024-06-10, 10:26:23 AM] Adam: And I did everything wrong
[2024-06-10, 10:26:28 AM] Adam: And you didn't want to meet up or anything
[2024-06-10, 10:26:34 AM] Adam: You make me look like the evil guy
[2024-06-10, 10:26:38 AM] Zoe: I always wanted to meet up
[2024-06-10, 10:26:44 AM] Zoe: Well here you are
[2024-06-10, 10:26:44 AM] Adam: Ok let me honestly ask you
[2024-06-10, 10:26:47 AM] Adam: There will and always be
[2024-06-10, 10:26:49 AM] Zoe: But you can redeem yourself
[2024-06-10, 10:26:52 AM] Adam: A risk factor meeting up with an ex
[2024-06-10, 10:26:55 AM] Adam: That you admitted
[2024-06-10, 10:27:01 AM] Adam: Sexually validates you
[2024-06-10, 10:27:07 AM] Zoe: Yes but I thought I could keep it to nothing
[2024-06-10, 10:27:14 AM] Adam: Ok and it was absolutely nothing
[2024-06-10, 10:27:16 AM] Adam: Grinding ?
[2024-06-10, 10:27:17 AM] Zoe: I thought I could keep you at arms length
[2024-06-10, 10:27:22 AM] Adam: Bro that's like school yard shit
[2024-06-10, 10:27:29 AM] Adam: There was no kissing
[2024-06-10, 10:27:31 AM] Zoe: I don’t care! I wanted nothing!!!!
[2024-06-10, 10:27:33 AM] Adam: Now did you flirt ?
[2024-06-10, 10:27:34 AM] Adam: Yes
[2024-06-10, 10:27:37 AM] Adam: You flirted
[2024-06-10, 10:27:45 AM] Adam: You were close to me outside
[2024-06-10, 10:27:48 AM] Adam: You kept touching my face
[2024-06-10, 10:27:51 AM] Adam: And looking into my eyes
[2024-06-10, 10:27:55 AM] Adam: When we were grinding
[2024-06-10, 10:28:09 AM] Adam: You almost broke and were gonna kiss me but didn't <This message was edited>
[2024-06-10, 10:28:51 AM] Zoe: Look. When you leave, I stay here and I have to deal with thinking about this. No amount of mental coaching is going to help me.
[2024-06-10, 10:28:59 AM] Zoe: Just leave me alone, what’s done is done
[2024-06-10, 10:29:09 AM] Adam: That's not true
[2024-06-10, 10:29:16 AM] Adam: This may actually help you with your relationship with gkm
[2024-06-10, 10:29:18 AM] Adam: How ?
[2024-06-10, 10:29:22 AM] Zoe: Fuck off
[2024-06-10, 10:29:24 AM] Adam: You won't feel like you have to settle..
[2024-06-10, 10:29:34 AM] Adam: You won't feel like you're 40 years old
[2024-06-10, 10:29:37 AM] Adam: And old and ugly
[2024-06-10, 10:29:42 AM] Adam: And can't get him hard
[2024-06-10, 10:29:53 AM] Adam: You've destroyed your self-esteem with him
[2024-06-10, 10:30:01 AM] Adam: What you love is that I validate you
[2024-06-10, 10:30:08 AM] Adam: I make you feel like you're young and sexy
[2024-06-10, 10:30:12 AM] Adam: And all you do is this
[2024-06-10, 10:31:13 AM] Zoe: Leave me alone
[2024-06-10, 10:31:24 AM] Adam: You blocked this contact
[2024-06-10, 9:06:23 PM] Adam: You unblocked this contact
[2024-06-10, 9:06:40 PM] Zoe: You deleted this message.
[2024-06-10, 9:07:32 PM] Adam: You blocked this contact
[2024-06-10, 9:12:32 PM] Adam: You unblocked this contact
[2024-06-10, 9:12:39 PM] Zoe: I want us to stop talking
[2024-06-10, 9:12:55 PM] Zoe: I wish you wouldn’t email me
[2024-06-10, 9:13:09 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-10, 9:13:10 PM] Adam: Why
[2024-06-10, 9:13:18 PM] Zoe: You think im dramatic
[2024-06-10, 9:13:22 PM] Zoe: I know I am
[2024-06-10, 9:13:35 PM] Zoe: But I’d prefer if we didn’t remain in contact
[2024-06-10, 9:13:40 PM] Adam: Why
[2024-06-10, 9:13:46 PM] Adam: Did you see Chris
[2024-06-10, 9:13:56 PM] Zoe: Yes and I fought with him
[2024-06-10, 9:14:05 PM] Adam: Why ?
[2024-06-10, 9:14:09 PM] Zoe: Because I didn’t like something about him
[2024-06-10, 9:14:16 PM] Zoe: Cause I compare
[2024-06-10, 9:14:20 PM] Zoe: Or something
[2024-06-10, 9:14:25 PM] Adam: What was it
[2024-06-10, 9:14:33 PM] Adam: Because maybe there was merit in doing that
[2024-06-10, 9:14:38 PM] Zoe: Something about him trying to be unique
[2024-06-10, 9:14:39 PM] Adam: Not necessarily because you're comparing
[2024-06-10, 9:14:47 PM] Zoe: No there’s no use in fighting
[2024-06-10, 9:14:55 PM] Adam: He was trying to be unique ?
[2024-06-10, 9:15:10 PM] Zoe: Something like that, a little more complicated
[2024-06-10, 9:15:24 PM] Zoe: I’m not going to meet with you
[2024-06-10, 9:15:32 PM] Zoe: I don’t want to risk anything else happening
[2024-06-10, 9:15:37 PM] Zoe: You should know that
[2024-06-10, 9:15:42 PM] Zoe: So you don’t waste your time
[2024-06-10, 9:16:18 PM] Adam: Why not ? There's no risk if I keep my distance
[2024-06-10, 9:16:38 PM] Adam: Also who is to say your relationship is going to work out with all the issues you have
[2024-06-10, 9:16:59 PM] Zoe: Doesn’t mean I should see you if my relationship isn’t working out
[2024-06-10, 9:17:10 PM] Adam: Yes it does...
[2024-06-10, 9:17:14 PM] Zoe: Uh no
[2024-06-10, 9:17:17 PM] Adam: I'm the closest person to you lol
[2024-06-10, 9:17:29 PM] Adam: We talk about the deepest things
[2024-06-10, 9:17:35 PM] Zoe: Not really
[2024-06-10, 9:17:37 PM] Adam: We fight a lot sure
[2024-06-10, 9:17:38 PM] Zoe: Deep
[2024-06-10, 9:17:43 PM] Adam: But you and I know each other well
[2024-06-10, 9:18:02 PM] Adam: I just miss you that's why I want to see you
[2024-06-10, 9:18:05 PM] Zoe: If I knew you well I’d understand that I can’t get anything from you
[2024-06-10, 9:18:27 PM] Adam: But how can you get anything now if it's all so complicated..
[2024-06-10, 9:18:41 PM] Adam: In a different world if he wasn't an obstacle
[2024-06-10, 9:18:46 PM] Adam: Who knows what would have happened
[2024-06-10, 9:19:25 PM] Zoe: You saying things like “us doing X or talking X is going to bring you and Chris closer”
[2024-06-10, 9:19:32 PM] Zoe: Is dumb
[2024-06-10, 9:19:39 PM] Adam: Not directly
[2024-06-10, 9:19:44 PM] Adam: But it will actually make you realize
[2024-06-10, 9:19:50 PM] Adam: That you have a lot more to offer
[2024-06-10, 9:19:56 PM] Adam: And finding someone isn't difficult for you
[2024-06-10, 9:20:16 PM] Adam: You were down before
[2024-06-10, 9:20:17 PM] Zoe: Finding someone I like is difficult
[2024-06-10, 9:20:19 PM] Adam: You felt old
[2024-06-10, 9:20:22 PM] Adam: You didn't feel sexy
[2024-06-10, 9:20:25 PM] Zoe: Isn’t it for you?
[2024-06-10, 9:20:42 PM] Adam: It is for everyone not because we ourselves make it difficult
[2024-06-10, 9:20:44 PM] Zoe: Or do you like most?
[2024-06-10, 9:20:46 PM] Adam: It's just difficult logistically
[2024-06-10, 9:21:06 PM] Zoe: Are you talking about the girl that moved away from you
[2024-06-10, 9:21:13 PM] Adam: Who?
[2024-06-10, 9:21:23 PM] Zoe: The girl you were seeing
[2024-06-10, 9:21:27 PM] Zoe: After me
[2024-06-10, 9:21:46 PM] Adam: No I'm just saying that this helps you see
[2024-06-10, 9:21:59 PM] Adam: That you are beautiful
[2024-06-10, 9:22:03 PM] Adam: And sexy and smart
[2024-06-10, 9:22:09 PM] Adam: And age has nothing to do with it
[2024-06-10, 9:22:21 PM] Adam: Look how much I chase you lol
[2024-06-10, 9:22:57 PM] Zoe: I’m fucked up
[2024-06-10, 9:23:04 PM] Zoe: More than any of that
[2024-06-10, 9:23:08 PM] Adam: Aren't we all man
[2024-06-10, 9:23:18 PM] Zoe: You too
[2024-06-10, 9:23:20 PM] Zoe: I know
[2024-06-10, 9:23:20 PM] Adam: That's just life lol
[2024-06-10, 9:23:36 PM] Adam: I enjoy being around you
[2024-06-10, 9:23:42 PM] Adam: Sure I do like to hug and kiss
[2024-06-10, 9:23:47 PM] Adam: That's because I'm just drawn to you
[2024-06-10, 9:23:54 PM] Adam: I don't enjoy doing it
[2024-06-10, 9:24:19 PM] Zoe: You won’t meet with me without touching me, that’s what I wanted for when we meet. Not to touch. I wanted to be in control
[2024-06-10, 9:24:30 PM] Adam: I will
[2024-06-10, 9:24:34 PM] Adam: I understand it now
[2024-06-10, 9:24:48 PM] Adam: And I Will align with boundaries
[2024-06-10, 9:25:15 PM] Adam: I'll stay on my side and not ask for hugs
[2024-06-10, 9:25:42 PM] Zoe: I don’t know if I can trust you
[2024-06-10, 9:25:55 PM] Zoe: That’s why I wanted it to be in a place
[2024-06-10, 9:26:06 PM] Adam: I promise you I won't l. I will respect my space and yours.
[2024-06-10, 9:26:48 PM] Zoe: Why can’t it be inside an establishment
[2024-06-10, 9:27:12 PM] Zoe: Why do you have to make a bunch of lies about weather and comfort
[2024-06-10, 9:27:25 PM] Adam: Ok first of all those weren't lies.
[2024-06-10, 9:27:38 PM] Adam: Ever since I got back I just don't like going to Ottawa places lol
[2024-06-10, 9:27:47 PM] Adam: I also am not lying another the weather
[2024-06-10, 9:27:50 PM] Adam: It's very very strange
[2024-06-10, 9:27:54 PM] Zoe: Why?

[2024-06-10, 9:28:12 PM] Zoe: image omitted
[2024-06-10, 9:28:23 PM] Adam: So those aren't lies.
[2024-06-10, 9:28:34 PM] Adam: Idk I just like comfort, somewhere warm and relaxing
[2024-06-10, 9:28:38 PM] Adam: Like at my Dubai apartment

[2024-06-10, 9:29:56 PM] Adam: Or just to chat or whatever
[2024-06-10, 9:30:05 PM] Adam: I am starting to just love cozy spots

[2024-06-10, 9:30:50 PM] Zoe: But I think it’s time for us to let go
[2024-06-10, 9:30:55 PM] Adam: I will put some guardrails

[2024-06-10, 9:39:58 PM] Adam: You have my sworn word.
[2024-06-10, 9:40:10 PM] Zoe: My friend found out she’s 0% middle eastern. She did a DNA test and she’s 70% Italian
[2024-06-10, 9:40:27 PM] Adam: Ok ?
[2024-06-10, 9:41:51 PM] Adam: So ?
[2024-06-10, 9:42:28 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-10, 9:42:38 PM] Zoe: I already tried you
[2024-06-10, 9:43:00 PM] Adam: No before we didn't have these boundaries
[2024-06-10, 9:43:05 PM] Adam: We didn't speak about them .
[2024-06-10, 9:44:14 PM] Zoe: I’m busy
[2024-06-10, 9:44:37 PM] Adam: Please:(
[2024-06-10, 9:44:48 PM] Adam: I have been wanting to see you all day
[2024-06-10, 9:44:56 PM] Zoe: If you really wanted to you’d come to kettlemans
[2024-06-10, 9:45:59 PM] Adam: That's not true..
[2024-06-10, 9:46:04 PM] Adam: I just want to be comfortable
[2024-06-10, 9:46:14 PM] Adam: Let me come pick you up from there
[2024-06-10, 9:47:19 PM] Zoe: You can come sit here
[2024-06-10, 9:47:31 PM] Zoe: But if you don’t say yes I’m going home
[2024-06-10, 9:47:41 PM] Adam: Can I pick you up and we can take a drive ?
[2024-06-10, 9:47:43 PM] Zoe: And saying goodnight
[2024-06-10, 9:47:45 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-10, 9:47:52 PM] Adam: No stopping just driving ?
[2024-06-10, 9:47:56 PM] Zoe: These are the boundaries I want
[2024-06-10, 9:48:11 PM] Zoe: My guess is you’re not saying yes
[2024-06-10, 9:48:14 PM] Adam: I can't do anything when I am driving 😂
[2024-06-10, 9:48:28 PM] Zoe: Ok I’m going home
[2024-06-10, 9:48:31 PM] Zoe: Goodnight
[2024-06-10, 9:48:58 PM] Adam: How about taking a walk ?
[2024-06-10, 9:49:19 PM] Zoe: No I wanna be inside
[2024-06-10, 9:49:35 PM] Zoe: Ok I’m going home, night
[2024-06-10, 9:49:37 PM] Adam: Why it's nice to take a walk ..I can grab a jacket.
[2024-06-10, 9:50:28 PM] Zoe: Night Adam
[2024-06-10, 9:50:39 PM] Zoe: Maybe we can meet up another day maybe not
[2024-06-10, 9:50:57 PM] Adam: Why tho? I am agreeing to a walk ..
[2024-06-10, 9:51:03 PM] Adam: Why do you want to be inside kettleman
[2024-06-10, 9:51:07 PM] Adam: You know it's uncomfortable lol
[2024-06-10, 9:51:29 PM] Adam: I just want somewhere that's comfortable and quiet not a restaurant or whatever
[2024-06-10, 9:51:36 PM] Adam: I'll take a walk
[2024-06-10, 9:51:41 PM] Adam: I'll sit in a park bench
[2024-06-10, 9:53:02 PM] Zoe: It’s not what I want
[2024-06-10, 9:53:32 PM] Zoe: This time I do what I want
[2024-06-10, 9:53:44 PM] Zoe: And I really shouldn’t be seeing you anyways
[2024-06-10, 9:54:27 PM] Adam: I want to come for 30 mins and leave
[2024-06-10, 9:54:48 PM] Adam: I am down for anything I just don't want to be in a random restaurant
[2024-06-10, 9:55:19 PM] Adam: I am dying to see you 😔
[2024-06-10, 9:55:40 PM] Zoe: Then come by in an establishment
[2024-06-10, 10:05:50 PM] Adam: You're mean I want to see you now :(
[2024-06-10, 10:13:05 PM] Adam: So?
[2024-06-10, 10:23:13 PM] Zoe: I’m in bed
[2024-06-10, 10:25:40 PM] Adam: Okay
[2024-06-10, 10:33:22 PM] Adam: Tomorrow ?
[2024-06-10, 10:33:39 PM] Adam: Hmm
[2024-06-10, 10:39:27 PM] Zoe: I dunno
[2024-06-10, 10:39:30 PM] Zoe: Inside
[2024-06-10, 10:39:39 PM] Zoe: A restaurant or establishment
[2024-06-10, 10:39:44 PM] Zoe: Surely you have to eat?
[2024-06-10, 10:40:41 PM] Adam: When are you going to see him ?
[2024-06-10, 10:42:22 PM] Zoe: I saw him tonight
[2024-06-10, 10:42:27 PM] Zoe: Maybe I will see him tomorrow
[2024-06-10, 10:42:31 PM] Zoe: Who knows
[2024-06-10, 10:42:31 PM] Adam: What happened
[2024-06-10, 10:42:39 PM] Zoe: We had a fight
[2024-06-10, 10:42:45 PM] Adam: Any suspicion
[2024-06-10, 10:42:49 PM] Zoe: I subconsciously was comparing you and him
[2024-06-10, 10:42:58 PM] Zoe: No but he brings you up often
[2024-06-10, 10:43:02 PM] Adam: How do
[2024-06-10, 10:43:03 PM] Adam: So
[2024-06-10, 10:43:08 PM] Adam: In what way
[2024-06-10, 10:43:52 PM] Zoe: “And I get paranoid, that your first response is excitement to tell Adam about it. 

Are the fights to avoid those discussions?
like, that is what would have happened next if we didnt fight, we would have started talking about the serious stuff.”
[2024-06-10, 10:44:18 PM] Zoe: Im fucked
[2024-06-10, 10:44:23 PM] Adam: Huh
[2024-06-10, 10:44:23 PM] Zoe: He’s very nice
[2024-06-10, 10:44:36 PM] Zoe: About it - our fights
[2024-06-10, 10:45:06 PM] Adam: You want it to work with him?
[2024-06-10, 10:45:20 PM] Adam: Do you really want me to stay away?
[2024-06-10, 10:45:40 PM] Zoe: I’m pretty sure that would be better unfortunately 😢
[2024-06-10, 10:45:44 PM] Zoe: If you did
[2024-06-10, 10:45:51 PM] Adam: Ok I don't mind
[2024-06-10, 10:45:50 PM] Zoe: Go away
[2024-06-10, 10:45:59 PM] Adam: As long as that's what you want
[2024-06-10, 10:46:03 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-10, 10:46:20 PM] Adam: Because you two seem to involve me a lot...
[2024-06-10, 10:46:20 PM] Zoe: Peace in the Middle East
[2024-06-10, 10:46:23 PM] Adam: And it's weird..
[2024-06-10, 10:46:27 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-10, 10:46:31 PM] Adam: I've got nothing to do with your relationship.
[2024-06-10, 10:46:34 PM] Adam: Or why it's failing
[2024-06-10, 10:46:34 PM] Zoe: Yup
[2024-06-10, 10:46:36 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-10, 10:46:41 PM] Zoe: This isn’t leaving
[2024-06-10, 10:46:42 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-10, 10:46:45 PM] Adam: I feel like you both use me as a cop out.
[2024-06-10, 10:46:48 PM] Zoe: Sure
[2024-06-10, 10:46:50 PM] Adam: Which is very strange and weird.
[2024-06-10, 10:46:55 PM] Zoe: Ok so you should leave
[2024-06-10, 10:47:02 PM] Adam: Sure.
[2024-06-10, 10:47:02 PM] Zoe: Just block me
[2024-06-10, 10:47:19 PM] Adam: If that's what you want.
[2024-06-10, 10:47:21 PM] Zoe: Yup
[2024-06-10, 10:47:23 PM] Adam: I won't message.
[2024-06-10, 10:47:25 PM] Zoe: Thx
[2024-06-10, 10:47:37 PM] Adam: You blocked this contact
[2024-06-11, 8:26:46 AM] Adam: You unblocked this contact
[2024-06-11, 8:27:31 AM] Zoe: He thinks I’m using you as a crutch to not get serious in his and my relationship
[2024-06-11, 8:28:03 AM] Zoe: Because I have told him that commitment scares me
[2024-06-11, 8:28:22 AM] Zoe: And being with one person scares me
[2024-06-11, 8:28:43 AM] Zoe: He wants to get serious
[2024-06-11, 8:29:18 AM] Zoe: It might be me that’s holding back
[2024-06-11, 8:36:43 AM] Adam: But that's not necessarily true ?
[2024-06-11, 8:37:00 AM] Adam: Don't you want commitment?
[2024-06-11, 8:38:39 AM] Zoe: I’m scared of being with one person
[2024-06-11, 8:38:41 AM] Zoe: Aren’t you?
[2024-06-11, 8:39:03 AM] Zoe: Picking the wrong person
[2024-06-11, 8:39:40 AM] Zoe: Or because certain moods, having fights with that person
[2024-06-11, 8:39:46 AM] Zoe: Things like that.
[2024-06-11, 8:39:52 AM] Zoe: You’re not scared?
[2024-06-11, 8:40:02 AM] Zoe: I suppose because you don’t want to settle down?
[2024-06-11, 8:40:28 AM] Zoe: Or do you think that person will come and you will be no longer afraid
[2024-06-11, 8:52:50 AM] Adam: So you obviously have reservations and issues that have nothing to do with me and are more internal...
[2024-06-11, 8:53:20 AM] Adam: Because when you talk to me, it's almost as if you're the one waiting on him and you want to get serious..
[2024-06-11, 8:53:33 AM] Adam: But here it seems like he's ready and you're holding back.
[2024-06-11, 8:53:50 AM] Zoe: Yeah I know
[2024-06-11, 8:56:41 AM] Zoe: It’s always more complicated than you think
[2024-06-11, 9:03:11 AM] Adam: So it's not just me ?
[2024-06-11, 9:05:31 AM] Zoe: You must have some sort of personality thing or be doing something that I’m addicted to. Maybe because you give me attention and take it away?
[2024-06-11, 9:05:50 AM] Zoe: But yeah if you weren’t in the picture it would be a lot easier for me
[2024-06-11, 9:06:14 AM] Zoe: To face a commitment… and work through things with him 1 on 1
[2024-06-11, 9:06:33 AM] Zoe: I’ve kinda secretly cut myself in half
[2024-06-11, 9:06:56 AM] Zoe: It all sounds phoney to you I’m sure
[2024-06-11, 9:07:52 AM] Zoe: Like this is fucked up, did I make a fight yesterday with him so I wouldn’t feel as guilty to see you later
[2024-06-11, 9:07:55 AM] Zoe: I hope not
[2024-06-11, 9:08:16 AM] Zoe: And you love explaining things so it appears I don’t like you, so I can rely on that
[2024-06-11, 9:08:38 AM] Zoe: And I suppose I like explaining things that show you don’t like me… maybe we are somewhat similar
[2024-06-11, 9:08:51 AM] Zoe: You said we get deep, we really don’t
[2024-06-11, 9:09:06 AM] Adam: No I don't think you intentionally started a fight to avoid guilt..
[2024-06-11, 9:09:18 AM] Adam: I think you started a fight because your mindset is where it is at..
[2024-06-11, 9:09:36 AM] Zoe: lol i can count on you to say that
[2024-06-11, 9:09:36 AM] Adam: There's validity in the issues you're raising, the fear of commitment etc.
[2024-06-11, 9:09:53 AM] Adam: I'm sure you also have some personal reasons associated with him and his lifestyle...
[2024-06-11, 9:10:31 AM] Adam: I don't know if that's true..I think maybe your mindset would slip back into "I am better off settling" because no one else is in the picture..
[2024-06-11, 9:10:55 AM] Adam: So rather than work out your problems, you would actually submit to them and write them off..
[2024-06-11, 9:12:05 AM] Adam: You instantly thought he would be able to read your face and get suspicious..
[2024-06-11, 9:12:21 AM] Adam: But that wasn't true and I think it's because in your mind, you had hardwired it differently..
[2024-06-11, 9:16:43 AM] Zoe: What’s that mean
[2024-06-11, 9:17:39 AM] Adam: You are starting to realize that it isn't cheating and there's no guilt attached..
[2024-06-11, 9:17:49 AM] Adam: This message was deleted.
[2024-06-11, 9:19:47 AM] Adam: Has the guilt not worn off? Do you feel as guilty as what you had anticipated?
[2024-06-11, 9:21:53 AM] Zoe: I still feel baseline guilty yes
[2024-06-11, 9:22:22 AM] Adam: See...I don't just talk a lot lol..
[2024-06-11, 9:23:35 AM] Adam: And that feeling is the reason why he hasn't asked or felt suspicious.
[2024-06-11, 9:23:47 AM] Adam: If you were in a relationship today, I wouldn't meet up with you..
[2024-06-11, 9:24:00 AM] Adam: You two are on a break and trying to figure yourselves out..
[2024-06-11, 9:27:09 AM] Zoe: He hasn’t asked or felt suspicious?
[2024-06-11, 9:27:15 AM] Zoe: He has been suspicious
[2024-06-11, 9:27:25 AM] Zoe: Called in the night
[2024-06-11, 9:27:30 AM] Zoe: Asked me who I’m with
[2024-06-11, 9:27:47 AM] Zoe: Asking me what I did earlier
[2024-06-11, 9:31:40 AM] Adam: Yesterday?
[2024-06-11, 9:31:47 AM] Adam: After you left ?
[2024-06-11, 9:31:55 AM] Zoe: No the day I saw you
[2024-06-11, 9:32:05 AM] Adam: Ah why tho ?
[2024-06-11, 9:32:17 AM] Adam: I'm sure it's because you didn't let him sleep over
[2024-06-11, 9:32:21 AM] Adam: And made it difficult for him to get sex..
[2024-06-11, 9:32:53 AM] Adam: What did you say ?
[2024-06-11, 9:32:56 AM] Adam: ..
[2024-06-11, 9:33:31 AM] Zoe: I just said I didn’t really do anything
[2024-06-11, 9:33:34 AM] Zoe: Anyways
[2024-06-11, 9:36:09 AM] Adam: Ok that wasn't that hard lol ...
[2024-06-11, 9:36:44 AM] Adam: I think when I left I was probably close to going to the doctor's
[2024-06-11, 9:36:54 AM] Adam: The blue ball level was astronomical
[2024-06-11, 9:36:59 AM] Adam: It felt like it was gonna pop
[2024-06-11, 9:37:13 AM] Adam: I've never been in so much pain
[2024-06-11, 9:37:17 AM] Zoe: Guess I’m not healthy for you
[2024-06-11, 9:37:32 AM] Adam: No definitely healthy
[2024-06-11, 9:37:40 AM] Adam: I'm I bad if I said
[2024-06-11, 9:37:48 AM] Zoe: No thanks
[2024-06-11, 9:37:47 AM] Adam: I loved every bit of those grinds
[2024-06-11, 9:37:54 AM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-11, 9:37:57 AM] Adam: Is that wrong
[2024-06-11, 9:38:06 AM] Adam: Does that make you mad ?
[2024-06-11, 9:38:23 AM] Adam: Or upset
[2024-06-11, 9:39:46 AM] Zoe: Angry
[2024-06-11, 9:39:52 AM] Zoe: I didn’t want to be grinded on
[2024-06-11, 9:40:40 AM] Adam: You did give me 4
[2024-06-11, 9:41:09 AM] Adam: Why am I so addicted
[2024-06-11, 9:41:12 AM] Adam: It's strange
[2024-06-11, 9:41:26 AM] Zoe: You have theorized why
[2024-06-11, 9:41:27 AM] Adam: Like that was worth the entire Canada trip 😂😂
[2024-06-11, 9:41:43 AM] Zoe: Your welcome

[2024-06-11, 10:00:05 AM] Adam: I'm enduring the pain
[2024-06-11, 10:00:21 AM] Adam: I think the way I see it is that if I did finish
[2024-06-11, 10:00:24 AM] Adam: Then it's selfish
[2024-06-11, 10:00:26 AM] Adam: So I'd rather not.
[2024-06-11, 10:00:32 AM] Adam: See I am not selfish
[2024-06-11, 10:03:17 AM] Adam: What do you make of that
[2024-06-11, 10:07:35 AM] Adam: It makes sense no ?

[2024-06-11, 10:08:36 AM] Adam: But I am willing to behave
[2024-06-11, 10:08:37 AM] Zoe: I’m glad you didn’t orgasm but you don’t deserve a medal
[2024-06-11, 10:08:42 AM] Adam: I honestly
[2024-06-11, 10:08:46 AM] Adam: Tried very hard not to
[2024-06-11, 10:08:51 AM] Adam: And it was purely because
[2024-06-11, 10:08:55 AM] Adam: I knew how you would have felt.
[2024-06-11, 10:09:00 AM] Adam: And I don't think I ever want to
[2024-06-11, 10:09:06 AM] Zoe: The only way I would meet with you is in a restaurant or establishment

[2024-06-11, 10:31:47 AM] Adam: How ?
[2024-06-11, 10:31:55 AM] Adam: Logistically that's impossible lol.
[2024-06-11, 10:31:57 AM] Adam: I'd be driving ...
[2024-06-11, 10:33:27 AM] Zoe: Then why would YOU want to meet without you being able to touch me
[2024-06-11, 10:33:33 AM] Zoe: Unless you go back on your word

[2024-06-13, 12:35:08 PM] Zoe: He was okay he just talked me through it
[2024-06-13, 12:35:15 PM] Zoe: Why I have these feelings
[2024-06-13, 12:35:31 PM] Zoe: He was expecting it , but didn’t know you were coming this month
[2024-06-13, 12:35:34 PM] Adam: Ah but you said nothing happened right ?
[2024-06-13, 12:35:47 PM] Zoe: I told him everything
[2024-06-13, 12:35:53 PM] Adam: That's definitely a lie lol
[2024-06-13, 12:35:57 PM] Zoe: Actually he just seemed happy that I didn’t sleep with you
[2024-06-13, 12:36:01 PM] Adam: You did not tell him everything
[2024-06-13, 12:36:04 PM] Zoe: Why are you fighting with me
[2024-06-13, 12:36:17 PM] Adam: What did you tell him happened?
[2024-06-13, 12:36:20 PM] Adam: He grinded on me ?
[2024-06-13, 12:37:58 PM] Adam: ?
[2024-06-13, 12:41:10 PM] Adam: I'm not fighting...just curious what was said

[2024-06-13, 1:09:16 PM] Zoe: Nunya
[2024-06-13, 1:14:24 PM] Adam: I don't think you told him.

[2024-06-13, 1:17:28 PM] Adam: It's fine you can block me again if you're just gonna give me one word answers.
[2024-06-13, 1:17:33 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-13, 1:17:39 PM] Zoe: Don’t ask me to unblock you
[2024-06-13, 1:17:49 PM] Adam: You unblock me and then just give one word.
[2024-06-13, 1:17:56 PM] Adam: What's the point in that lol .
[2024-06-13, 1:18:05 PM] Adam: You'd think you have more to say.
[2024-06-13, 1:18:11 PM] Zoe: The conversation is not going to go the way you want
[2024-06-13, 1:18:16 PM] Zoe: You can’t pry info out of people
[2024-06-13, 1:18:21 PM] Zoe: Sometimes you just have to move on
[2024-06-13, 1:18:24 PM] Adam: This isn't prying
[2024-06-13, 1:18:26 PM] Adam: It's asking
[2024-06-13, 1:18:27 PM] Zoe: Might be a good lesson for you
[2024-06-13, 1:18:38 PM] Adam: You're giving answers that aren't really answers
[2024-06-13, 1:18:43 PM] Zoe: So?
[2024-06-13, 1:18:50 PM] Adam: So why tell me at all ?
[2024-06-13, 1:18:56 PM] Adam: .

[2024-06-13, 1:20:41 PM] Adam: Stupido
[2024-06-13, 1:20:47 PM] Zoe: I wanted to
[2024-06-13, 1:20:55 PM] Adam: So he was completely fijen
[2024-06-13, 1:21:01 PM] Adam: And quite relieved
[2024-06-13, 1:21:04 PM] Adam: Because we didn't have sex ?

[2024-06-13, 1:24:15 PM] Adam: So had you kissed ?
[2024-06-13, 1:24:34 PM] Adam: He would be fine ?
[2024-06-13, 1:24:44 PM] Zoe: Nah I don’t think so

[2024-06-13, 1:25:34 PM] Adam: If you met up with me again
[2024-06-13, 1:25:41 PM] Zoe: I don’t want to talk about that right now
[2024-06-13, 1:25:45 PM] Adam: Seems like he's fine
[2024-06-13, 1:25:46 PM] Zoe: I want stock advice
[2024-06-13, 1:25:49 PM] Adam: As long as we don't have sex

[2024-06-13, 1:26:10 PM] Adam: Send me a screenshot
[2024-06-13, 1:31:29 PM] Zoe: image omitted
[2024-06-13, 1:31:39 PM] Zoe: I don’t see a point in selling my junk
[2024-06-13, 1:33:29 PM] Adam: I think don't sell them.
[2024-06-13, 1:33:34 PM] Adam: There's no need to sell them.
[2024-06-13, 1:33:37 PM] Zoe: Yeah
[2024-06-13, 1:33:43 PM] Adam: But I think you should start buying VOO
[2024-06-13, 1:33:52 PM] Zoe: Is that an etf?
[2024-06-13, 1:33:56 PM] Adam: That's basically the S&P 500
[2024-06-13, 1:34:05 PM] Adam: ETF
[2024-06-13, 1:34:21 PM] Adam: This is a stock you should buy once a month as part of a 20+ year retirement plan.
[2024-06-13, 1:34:25 PM] Zoe: Do I pay a cost ? Is it Canadian?
[2024-06-13, 1:34:35 PM] Adam: It's US.
[2024-06-13, 1:34:46 PM] Zoe: I’m in the government I have a retirement plan
[2024-06-13, 1:34:56 PM] Zoe: I want moneys noooowwe
[2024-06-13, 1:34:57 PM] Adam: Still doesn't hurt to have your own
[2024-06-13, 1:35:09 PM] Adam: Your cash is basically sitting in the bank not working for you ..
[2024-06-13, 1:35:14 PM] Zoe: I want to stock pick :(
[2024-06-13, 1:35:30 PM] Adam: I trade options.
[2024-06-13, 1:35:38 PM] Adam: I have my retirement stocks
[2024-06-13, 1:35:49 PM] Adam: That I buy once a month
[2024-06-13, 1:35:56 PM] Adam: And then I options trade weekly
[2024-06-13, 1:36:10 PM] Zoe: Can I do a bit of that in my tfsa?
[2024-06-13, 1:36:41 PM] Zoe: Am I trading options?
[2024-06-13, 1:36:48 PM] Zoe: If I buy stocks?
[2024-06-13, 1:37:01 PM] Adam: No
[2024-06-13, 1:37:07 PM] Adam: Options are contracts
[2024-06-13, 1:37:12 PM] Zoe: No to which
[2024-06-13, 1:37:22 PM] Adam: You aren't trading options
[2024-06-13, 1:37:24 PM] Zoe: So we’re not doing the same thing
[2024-06-13, 1:37:28 PM] Zoe: Can I call
[2024-06-13, 1:37:42 PM] Adam: Equity trading is what you're doing..you're buying shares.
[2024-06-13, 1:38:06 PM] Adam: Options trading is basically buying a contract that either gives you the right but not the obligation to buy shares or gives you the right but not the obligation to sell shares.
[2024-06-13, 1:38:09 PM] Adam: Calls and Puts
[2024-06-13, 1:38:23 PM] Zoe: Why not trade shares?
[2024-06-13, 1:38:29 PM] Zoe: Is it in your tfsa?
[2024-06-13, 1:39:11 PM] Adam: Well take Tesla for example ..in order for me to see any growth I'd need to buy 50-100 shares of Tesla at $175
[2024-06-13, 1:39:32 PM] Zoe: Why aren’t everybody trading options?
[2024-06-13, 1:40:10 PM] Adam: A lot of people are...so yesterday I bought a call option for $1300 for the right to purchase 100 shares of Tesla within 21 days at $172/share.
[2024-06-13, 1:40:39 PM] Adam: Tesla is at $184 right now..so I can either sell that contract and make my profit.
[2024-06-13, 1:40:55 PM] Adam: Or I can exercise the contract and purchase the 100 shares.
[2024-06-13, 1:40:59 PM] Adam: I never exercise.
[2024-06-13, 1:41:20 PM] Adam: I sell the call option.
[2024-06-13, 1:41:29 PM] Zoe: How come I’m buying shares and you’re buying options
[2024-06-13, 1:41:52 PM] Zoe: Do you need a license?
[2024-06-13, 1:42:14 PM] Adam: You need a margin account.
[2024-06-13, 1:42:17 PM] Adam: Slightly different.
[2024-06-13, 1:46:07 PM] Zoe: Do you also have stocks?
[2024-06-13, 1:47:13 PM] Adam: I do..
[2024-06-13, 1:47:20 PM] Adam: I have ETFs that I don't touch ever.
[2024-06-13, 1:47:40 PM] Adam: I don't ever sell them, I only buy and they are part of my long term goals.
[2024-06-13, 1:47:48 PM] Zoe: Hmmm
[2024-06-13, 1:47:59 PM] Adam: Let's meet up I can show you :)
[2024-06-13, 1:48:03 PM] Zoe: But I want my money to beat inflation but also be liquid in case I wanna buy
[2024-06-13, 1:48:04 PM] Adam: "no thanks"
[2024-06-13, 1:48:11 PM] Adam: 😂
[2024-06-13, 1:48:13 PM] Zoe: Don’t you have nvidia stocks
[2024-06-13, 1:48:25 PM] Adam: Then don't buy ETFs
[2024-06-13, 1:48:34 PM] Adam: It's not worth it because you're not meant to sell them.
[2024-06-13, 1:48:35 PM] Zoe: Argh
[2024-06-13, 1:48:45 PM] Adam: Do you want to meet up
[2024-06-13, 1:48:57 PM] Adam: I can show you
[2024-06-13, 1:49:04 PM] Zoe: I don’t want you to touch me and I don’t think you can help yourself
[2024-06-13, 1:49:12 PM] Zoe: I’ve already not learned
[2024-06-13, 1:49:14 PM] Adam: Ah I'm over that.
[2024-06-13, 1:49:20 PM] Zoe: How do?
[2024-06-13, 1:49:21 PM] Zoe: So
[2024-06-13, 1:49:30 PM] Zoe: Why would you want to meet up then?
[2024-06-13, 1:49:32 PM] Adam: Don't really feel the urge 😂
[2024-06-13, 1:49:38 PM] Zoe: Why?
[2024-06-13, 1:49:54 PM] Adam: Not sure, I don't really have much else to do ?
[2024-06-13, 1:50:03 PM] Adam: I leave for Toronto over the weekend
[2024-06-13, 1:50:16 PM] Zoe: Oh I was free this weekend

[2024-06-13, 1:51:10 PM] Adam: I've got friends that are there and I've got some meetings as well.

[2024-06-13, 1:52:47 PM] Zoe: image omitted
[2024-06-13, 1:52:55 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-13, 1:53:02 PM] Adam: So wait does he actually know we met up ?
[2024-06-13, 1:53:07 PM] Zoe: Yeah
[2024-06-13, 1:53:11 PM] Adam: And he knows what happened ?
[2024-06-13, 1:53:15 PM] Zoe: Yeah
[2024-06-13, 1:53:20 PM] Adam: And is he going to leave you ?
[2024-06-13, 1:53:27 PM] Zoe: Don’t know
[2024-06-13, 1:53:36 PM] Zoe: Did you leave me?
[2024-06-13, 1:53:36 PM] Adam: Did you make it seem like I was purely at fault lol ?
[2024-06-13, 1:53:49 PM] Adam: Like I was the one who came onto you ?
[2024-06-13, 1:54:06 PM] Zoe: You deleted this message.
[2024-06-13, 1:54:12 PM] Adam: Answer my question
[2024-06-13, 1:54:26 PM] Zoe: Do I look like her
[2024-06-13, 1:54:36 PM] Adam: Why are you ignoring me tho?
[2024-06-13, 1:54:38 PM] Adam: It's rude.
[2024-06-13, 1:55:08 PM] Adam: Has he asked you to not see me again?
[2024-06-13, 1:55:44 PM] Adam: ?
[2024-06-13, 2:00:16 PM] Adam: Why do you randomly go silent when it comes to this topic ?
[2024-06-13, 2:00:26 PM] Adam: Especially after engaging with me when it came to stocks ?
[2024-06-13, 2:00:31 PM] Zoe: No lol he just said this
[2024-06-13, 2:00:38 PM] Zoe: oh no, you are not replying... you are visiting with the devil again
[2024-06-13, 2:00:38 PM] Adam: Just now ?
[2024-06-13, 2:01:01 PM] Adam: You told him you're talking to me again lol ?
[2024-06-13, 2:01:08 PM] Adam: And that we may meet up ?
[2024-06-13, 2:02:08 PM] Zoe: Yeah
[2024-06-13, 2:02:13 PM] Zoe: Exactly
[2024-06-13, 2:02:16 PM] Adam: Why ?
[2024-06-13, 2:02:18 PM] Zoe: Still want toner up?
[2024-06-13, 2:02:19 PM] Adam: Lol you're so weird...
[2024-06-13, 2:02:20 PM] Zoe: Meet up
[2024-06-13, 2:02:24 PM] Zoe: Or should I block you
[2024-06-13, 2:02:27 PM] Adam: Why do you do that ? 😂😂😂
[2024-06-13, 2:02:33 PM] Adam: Bro it's super weird and awkward...
[2024-06-13, 2:02:42 PM] Zoe: Then don’t meet up
[2024-06-13, 2:02:51 PM] Adam: Doesn't answer the why ?
[2024-06-13, 2:03:06 PM] Adam: Who does that lol ? What is the point of instigating?
[2024-06-13, 2:03:20 PM] Adam: It's like you want him to know you have someone else that admires or desires to meet up .
[2024-06-13, 2:03:40 PM] Adam: It's very manipulative and weird, I can't see any reason why someone would entertain the idea of meeting up and still let their ex know about it ...
[2024-06-13, 2:03:54 PM] Adam: What do you aim to achieve by telling him ? What was your intention?
[2024-06-13, 2:05:16 PM] Zoe: My big problem, is that I actually want, what makes you most happy… even if that is him.

But, I do not think that is the case, nor do I think you do,
I dont know what you think, and that’s ok
[2024-06-13, 2:05:39 PM] Adam: Bro 😂😂😂😂😂
[2024-06-13, 2:05:42 PM] Zoe: He doesn’t know that you and I don’t have a chance of a relationship
[2024-06-13, 2:05:43 PM] Adam: This is super super weird.
[2024-06-13, 2:05:44 PM] Adam: Jesus
[2024-06-13, 2:05:53 PM] Zoe: Whatever
[2024-06-13, 2:05:56 PM] Zoe: Go away then
[2024-06-13, 2:05:57 PM] Adam: Why ????
[2024-06-13, 2:06:02 PM] Adam: Why do you do this ?
[2024-06-13, 2:06:06 PM] Adam: It's so weird man...
[2024-06-13, 2:06:11 PM] Zoe: Keeps me accountable
[2024-06-13, 2:06:14 PM] Adam: I cannot even begin to think of a logical reason...
[2024-06-13, 2:06:18 PM] Adam: Accountable ???
[2024-06-13, 2:06:26 PM] Zoe: Yeah nothing will happen
[2024-06-13, 2:06:28 PM] Adam: Despite all of this, you're still down to meet up 😂😂
[2024-06-13, 2:06:37 PM] Zoe: I have an attraction to you
[2024-06-13, 2:06:39 PM] Adam: That's what is mystifying...
[2024-06-13, 2:06:42 PM] Adam: So why tell him ?
[2024-06-13, 2:06:48 PM] Zoe: I just hope eventually you’ll go away
[2024-06-13, 2:06:50 PM] Adam: It's so stupid.. especially because he doesn't seem to care..
[2024-06-13, 2:06:54 PM] Zoe: Which I’m sure you will
[2024-06-13, 2:06:57 PM] Adam: Why do you have to tell him
[2024-06-13, 2:07:02 PM] Adam: Just let it be..
[2024-06-13, 2:07:08 PM] Adam: The dude doesn't seem to care at all..
[2024-06-13, 2:07:21 PM] Adam: It's like you're forcing it on him .
[2024-06-13, 2:07:42 PM] Adam: Why don't you ask him
[2024-06-13, 2:07:48 PM] Adam: "Do you still want to date?"
[2024-06-13, 2:07:56 PM] Zoe: Maybe he’s indifferent too
[2024-06-13, 2:08:00 PM] Adam: Ask him.
[2024-06-13, 2:08:03 PM] Zoe: Maybe he doesn’t want to date
[2024-06-13, 2:08:03 PM] Adam: See what he says.
[2024-06-13, 2:08:09 PM] Adam: Ok ask...
[2024-06-13, 2:08:35 PM] Adam: So if he doesn't care..
[2024-06-13, 2:08:38 PM] Adam: And he doesn't seem to mind..
[2024-06-13, 2:08:49 PM] Adam: Why are you so hesitant on meeting up or whatever else ?
[2024-06-13, 2:09:05 PM] Adam: His cut-off point seems to be sex.
[2024-06-13, 2:09:09 PM] Zoe: I don’t want to do anything with you
[2024-06-13, 2:09:10 PM] Adam: Which will never happen..
[2024-06-13, 2:09:22 PM] Zoe: I don’t even want you to touch me
[2024-06-13, 2:09:27 PM] Zoe: Seriously
[2024-06-13, 2:09:32 PM] Adam: You said
[2024-06-13, 2:09:35 PM] Adam: If he was okay with it
[2024-06-13, 2:09:38 PM] Adam: We could kiss 😂😂😂
[2024-06-13, 2:09:41 PM] Zoe: ?
[2024-06-13, 2:09:44 PM] Zoe: You’re crazy
[2024-06-13, 2:09:43 PM] Adam: You did.
[2024-06-13, 2:09:47 PM] Zoe: Where
[2024-06-13, 2:09:57 PM] Zoe: Oh I said if you can get him to agree
[2024-06-13, 2:10:01 PM] Adam: Don't tell me where it was in the car.
[2024-06-13, 2:10:02 PM] Zoe: Not if I can get him to agree
[2024-06-13, 2:10:21 PM] Adam: Ok if this is the case
[2024-06-13, 2:10:27 PM] Adam: Let me come over then ?
[2024-06-13, 2:10:30 PM] Adam: Let's order some food .
[2024-06-13, 2:10:32 PM] Adam: Work on your stocks
[2024-06-13, 2:10:42 PM] Adam: Get you a budget plan
[2024-06-13, 2:12:33 PM] Zoe: Ha ha ha
[2024-06-13, 2:13:00 PM] Adam: Why not, it's actually better than the car.
[2024-06-13, 2:13:08 PM] Adam: We can actually work on something..
[2024-06-13, 2:13:24 PM] Adam: You also get to tell me when to leave at any given point.
[2024-06-13, 2:13:36 PM] Zoe: No I don’t invite you in
[2024-06-13, 2:13:37 PM] Zoe: Sorry
[2024-06-13, 2:13:44 PM] Adam: What's the big deal ?
[2024-06-13, 2:13:47 PM] Zoe: You’re wasting your time
[2024-06-13, 2:13:50 PM] Zoe: I don’t want to
[2024-06-13, 2:13:51 PM] Adam: Why ?
[2024-06-13, 2:13:54 PM] Adam: What's the reason ?
[2024-06-13, 2:14:12 PM] Adam: It's so much easier...you get to eat, work on stocks, and then I leave..
[2024-06-13, 2:14:21 PM] Adam: I stay downstairs..I sit on the floor or chair or whatever.. <This message was edited>
[2024-06-13, 2:14:47 PM] Adam: I get your portfolio in order and create you a budget plan on excel and then I leave ?
[2024-06-13, 2:15:05 PM] Adam: If at any point you're uncomfortable, just simply say leave.
[2024-06-13, 2:15:06 PM] Zoe: lol I can’t imagine a world where you would help me then leave
[2024-06-13, 2:15:25 PM] Adam: I've got nothing else to do and I have been very successful with my budget plan..
[2024-06-13, 2:15:39 PM] Adam: I also can't stay late so it works out really well...at any moment you say leave, I get up and go.
[2024-06-13, 2:16:02 PM] Adam: We order food, we work on your portfolio, I'll give you the plan I am using and then I go ..
[2024-06-13, 2:18:09 PM] Adam: image omitted
[2024-06-13, 2:18:25 PM] Zoe: Nice
[2024-06-13, 2:18:33 PM] Adam: I can show you how to setup a margin account and teach you the basics of options trading.
[2024-06-13, 2:18:45 PM] Adam: At least then we're productive and distracted...
[2024-06-13, 2:19:27 PM] Zoe: Hmm
[2024-06-13, 2:19:55 PM] Adam: Believe me I have no other intention...I have some free time and I think it's about time I show you.
[2024-06-13, 2:20:18 PM] Adam: Lunch is on me, I'll do what I said I'll do and then leave.
[2024-06-13, 2:21:01 PM] Adam: Your magic word is simply "I'd like you to leave" and I will leave.
[2024-06-13, 2:21:24 PM] Adam: That is a promise and an oath.
[2024-06-13, 2:24:59 PM] Zoe: You have no problem jeopardizing or risking our friendship/etc with hopes of sex or sexual contact <This message was edited>
[2024-06-13, 2:26:46 PM] Zoe: Your word doesn’t seem worthy
[2024-06-13, 2:28:48 PM] Zoe: I want dividend stock
[2024-06-13, 2:33:16 PM] Adam: That's not necessarily true, I have a problem with jeopardizing your relationship with Chris and I won't go that far.
[2024-06-13, 2:33:38 PM] Adam: You don't need to take my word for it...you have control...you want me gone just say the magic word and I'll be out.
[2024-06-13, 2:33:48 PM] Adam: I can show you all that as part of the plan..even a budget plan as well.
[2024-06-13, 2:33:59 PM] Adam: I can tell you which ones are good short term and which ones are good long term...
[2024-06-13, 2:34:07 PM] Zoe: You won’t touch me?
[2024-06-13, 2:34:13 PM] Adam: No.
[2024-06-13, 2:34:25 PM] Adam: Just need a laptop.
[2024-06-13, 2:34:30 PM] Zoe: When did you want to come
[2024-06-13, 2:34:44 PM] Adam: Now.
[2024-06-13, 2:34:48 PM] Zoe: Geez
[2024-06-13, 2:34:54 PM] Zoe: I really don’t want to invite you in
[2024-06-13, 2:35:00 PM] Zoe: It really doesn’t
[2024-06-13, 2:35:04 PM] Adam: Don't worry about your place..
[2024-06-13, 2:35:08 PM] Zoe: I’m not
[2024-06-13, 2:35:09 PM] Adam: I have no care for that.
[2024-06-13, 2:35:14 PM] Adam: I'm just here to do your stocks.
[2024-06-13, 2:35:17 PM] Adam: And I will leave.
[2024-06-13, 2:35:20 PM] Zoe: Why would you?
[2024-06-13, 2:35:25 PM] Adam: You also have full control whenever you want me out.
[2024-06-13, 2:35:34 PM] Zoe: I really don’t want you in my place
[2024-06-13, 2:35:43 PM] Adam: Because I have some free time.
[2024-06-13, 2:36:00 PM] Adam: You can get me to leave whenever.
[2024-06-13, 2:36:10 PM] Adam: As soon as you say I want you to leave, I'll be gone.
[2024-06-13, 2:36:25 PM] Zoe: Isn’t your presence damaging?
[2024-06-13, 2:36:30 PM] Adam: We will look at your current holdings. I will then give you potential holdings.
[2024-06-13, 2:36:36 PM] Adam: And then I'll give you a budget plan .
[2024-06-13, 2:36:47 PM] Adam: I'll be distracted lol I'm fine.
[2024-06-13, 2:36:57 PM] Zoe: But why do you have to come in
[2024-06-13, 2:37:05 PM] Zoe: I really don’t want you inside my house
[2024-06-13, 2:37:14 PM] Zoe: Why can’t you help me at a coffee shop
[2024-06-13, 2:37:17 PM] Zoe: 😭
[2024-06-13, 2:37:17 PM] Adam: It's so much easier, you're also at work...it's easier to do it inside.
[2024-06-13, 2:37:21 PM] Adam: Also you have full control as well..
[2024-06-13, 2:37:26 PM] Adam: You don't need to come in my car or anything.
[2024-06-13, 2:37:36 PM] Adam: As soon as you think I should leave just tell me and I'll go.
[2024-06-13, 2:37:51 PM] Zoe: Sorry I said I wouldn’t invite you
[2024-06-13, 2:37:54 PM] Zoe: I’m not folding
[2024-06-13, 2:38:31 PM] Adam: Just think about it for a second beyond saying you wouldn't..I'm not here to hangout and get distracted...I'm purely there to help with your finances...I'll be on your laptop.
[2024-06-13, 2:38:43 PM] Adam: I'll be working away and wouldn't be touching you or even looking around..
[2024-06-13, 2:39:06 PM] Adam: I'll finish what I have to do and I'll leave, simple as that..even if I'm inside for 2 mins and you feel like I should leave, just tell me and I'll go.
[2024-06-13, 2:39:15 PM] Zoe: M
[2024-06-13, 2:39:17 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-13, 2:39:19 PM] Zoe: I’m glad d
[2024-06-13, 2:39:21 PM] Adam: Why not ?
[2024-06-13, 2:39:22 PM] Zoe: Good
[2024-06-13, 2:39:24 PM] Zoe: Thanks
[2024-06-13, 2:39:27 PM] Adam: What is your reason ?
[2024-06-13, 2:39:33 PM] Adam: I will be in and out quickly..
[2024-06-13, 2:39:37 PM] Zoe: I don’t want you in my house
[2024-06-13, 2:39:43 PM] Zoe: It’s not an excuse
[2024-06-13, 2:39:51 PM] Zoe: You’re not allowed in
[2024-06-13, 2:39:54 PM] Adam: What for tho ? What is the issue ? I am coming to help you not to be there and hanging out..
[2024-06-13, 2:39:56 PM] Adam: Watching a movie..
[2024-06-13, 2:40:02 PM] Adam: It's not any different if a furnace guy came in 😂
[2024-06-13, 2:40:04 PM] Zoe: Nvm I don’t need your help
[2024-06-13, 2:40:48 PM] Adam: Look whatever reason you have, you are in control at all times..and I think it's about time I deliver on something without any other intentions...
[2024-06-13, 2:41:11 PM] Adam: As soon as you say leave, I'll go..it's easier than a coffee shop because you don't have to leave your place and it's quieter...
[2024-06-13, 2:41:27 PM] Zoe: Im not explaining anymore
[2024-06-13, 2:41:27 PM] Adam: I'll show you what to do with your current holdings..I've also got a list of some holdings you would like ..
[2024-06-13, 2:41:34 PM] Adam: They are dividends.
[2024-06-13, 2:41:37 PM] Zoe: Nvm
[2024-06-13, 2:41:42 PM] Zoe: Take care
[2024-06-13, 2:41:46 PM] Adam: Lol let me guess..
[2024-06-13, 2:41:50 PM] Adam: You brought it up with Chris..
[2024-06-13, 2:41:59 PM] Adam: You talked about it and then you reversed your decision..
[2024-06-13, 2:42:16 PM] Adam: But you won't explain how you were just about to invite me over and then suddenly flipped...
[2024-06-13, 2:42:33 PM] Zoe: U kidding
[2024-06-13, 2:42:40 PM] Zoe: I was never okay with inviting you
[2024-06-13, 2:42:47 PM] Adam: .
[2024-06-13, 2:42:52 PM] Adam: .
[2024-06-13, 2:43:06 PM] Adam: But I think you went to Chris
[2024-06-13, 2:43:13 PM] Zoe: Is that an invite?
[2024-06-13, 2:43:13 PM] Adam: And said something like Adam is coming over
[2024-06-13, 2:43:15 PM] Zoe: wtf
[2024-06-13, 2:43:18 PM] Adam: And then you talked about it.
[2024-06-13, 2:43:20 PM] Adam: And then suddenly flipped.
[2024-06-13, 2:43:55 PM] Adam: He probably "helped you see through it" or something
[2024-06-13, 2:44:15 PM] Adam: I told you, it's pure emotions for you..one moment you're this way and then in a single second you're flipping the table...
[2024-06-13, 2:44:59 PM] Adam: You really think there is anything wrong with inviting me over lol ? You're benefiting from this...you've always wanted to understand the stock market, dividends, ETFs, option trading etc.

I'm not using this as a way to get in...I'm saying it makes sense to do it indoors..
[2024-06-13, 2:45:18 PM] Adam: Unlike the car, it's your place and you have every bit of control over the situation..you don't need me to drive you home or whatever..
[2024-06-13, 2:45:48 PM] Adam: I'm not there to touch you or do anything sexual, I don't desire that at the moment and I'm coming strictly for helping you organize your finances..
[2024-06-13, 2:46:03 PM] Adam: You have a great ability to save money but you fail to take it to the next step..
[2024-06-13, 2:46:14 PM] Adam: You're not so good at investments and you're not allowing your money to work for you..
[2024-06-13, 2:48:47 PM] Zoe: Done
[2024-06-13, 2:49:25 PM] Adam: Done ?
[2024-06-13, 2:52:34 PM] Adam: ?

[2024-06-13, 6:17:42 PM] Adam: It'll be fun and cozy
[2024-06-13, 6:17:46 PM] Adam: Purely platonic
[2024-06-13, 6:22:41 PM] Zoe: No thx
[2024-06-13, 6:23:35 PM] Adam: Why :(
[2024-06-13, 6:23:43 PM] Adam: I want to come over and see you.
[2024-06-13, 6:23:47 PM] Adam: It's also raining outside...
[2024-06-13, 6:24:05 PM] Adam: Here's the deal I'll leave $100 with you, one touch and I forfeit the money lol
[2024-06-13, 6:25:44 PM] Zoe: I really don’t want you in my house
[2024-06-13, 6:26:19 PM] Adam: I'll also be extra extra sweet :)
[2024-06-13, 6:26:29 PM] Adam: Just the slightest touch and I lose the $100
[2024-06-13, 6:26:34 PM] Zoe: What’s that mean
[2024-06-13, 6:26:38 PM] Zoe: ?
[2024-06-13, 6:26:56 PM] Adam: Very nice and not mean
[2024-06-13, 6:26:57 PM] Zoe: You’re going to complain how messy it is
[2024-06-13, 6:27:08 PM] Adam: I just got back from Iran lol
[2024-06-13, 6:27:17 PM] Zoe: Doesn’t mean messy
[2024-06-13, 6:27:18 PM] Adam: Your place isn't messy
[2024-06-13, 6:27:23 PM] Zoe: It’s dirty
[2024-06-13, 6:27:25 PM] Adam: Also I have a messy room
[2024-06-13, 6:27:30 PM] Zoe: Show me
[2024-06-13, 6:27:33 PM] Adam: Who cares, does it smell ?
[2024-06-13, 6:28:24 PM] Adam: Is it clustered ?
[2024-06-13, 6:28:27 PM] Adam: Cluttered
[2024-06-13, 6:28:55 PM] Adam: I've seen it all trust me, messy isn't an issue
[2024-06-13, 6:29:06 PM] Adam: If you've got rotten food laying around and whatnot
[2024-06-13, 6:29:08 PM] Adam: That's bad

[2024-06-13, 6:50:14 PM] Adam: Why do you act like you're violating a major principle by me coming loll
[2024-06-13, 6:50:20 PM] Adam: It's not that deep...it really isn't lol .
[2024-06-13, 6:52:09 PM] Zoe: I just don’t see
[2024-06-13, 6:52:14 PM] Zoe: Why you would come over

[2024-06-13, 6:52:27 PM] Zoe: I mean
[2024-06-13, 6:52:29 PM] Adam: Ok here are the following reasons:
[2024-06-13, 6:52:33 PM] Zoe: Wait
[2024-06-13, 6:52:34 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-13, 6:52:38 PM] Adam: Lol

[2024-06-13, 6:52:50 PM] Zoe: I know
[2024-06-13, 6:52:57 PM] Zoe: I don’t wanna invite you over
[2024-06-13, 6:53:03 PM] Adam: Why ?
[2024-06-13, 6:53:05 PM] Zoe: I just want to see you outside my house
[2024-06-13, 6:53:08 PM] Zoe: But you don’t want to
[2024-06-13, 6:53:09 PM] Adam: Why tho ?
[2024-06-13, 6:53:14 PM] Adam: I've been trying to understand that
[2024-06-13, 6:53:35 PM] Zoe: If you don’t believe or want to accept my reasons you will keep trying to understand
[2024-06-13, 6:53:34 PM] Adam: It's better to be indoors, it's wet outside...we can order in..we can be productive...
[2024-06-13, 6:53:47 PM] Adam: We don't have to ever sit in the car which is trauma in itself .
[2024-06-13, 6:53:59 PM] Adam: I don't control the environment, so the moment you want me gone I'm out .
[2024-06-13, 6:54:10 PM] Adam: I have $100 on the line
[2024-06-13, 6:54:15 PM] Zoe: I don’t feel comfortable with you in my house
[2024-06-13, 6:54:19 PM] Adam: So I won't touch or complain..
[2024-06-13, 6:54:22 PM] Zoe: I was heart broken last time
[2024-06-13, 6:54:24 PM] Adam: Ok but in one second

[2024-06-13, 6:54:31 PM] Adam: And I'll be outside.
[2024-06-13, 6:54:43 PM] Adam: You'll see we'll just be working on your laptop..
[2024-06-13, 6:54:47 PM] Adam: We'll eat and I'll be gone..
[2024-06-13, 6:54:59 PM] Adam: It'll be much better than being outdoors..
[2024-06-13, 6:55:12 PM] Adam: Even if like 5 mins in your felt uncomfortable

[2024-06-13, 6:55:40 PM] Zoe: I would feel uncomfortable
[2024-06-13, 6:55:46 PM] Adam: Because of Chris ?
[2024-06-13, 6:55:49 PM] Zoe: You really want me to be uncomfortable in my own home

[2024-06-13, 6:56:10 PM] Adam: We will keep 5 feet distance
[2024-06-13, 6:57:04 PM] Zoe: I don’t think he would be comfortable with you coming here
[2024-06-13, 6:57:09 PM] Zoe: I’m positive
[2024-06-13, 6:57:26 PM] Adam: He wouldn't care as long as nothing happened lol .
[2024-06-13, 6:57:37 PM] Adam: Clearly he's indifferent..and I think he's taking the approach of just riding it out..

[2024-06-13, 7:00:09 PM] Adam: Ok so it's not because he's upset

[2024-06-14, 5:51:17 PM] Adam: Nothing is possible given your situation
[2024-06-14, 5:51:33 PM] Zoe: Usually it only goes one way… to the spam folder on gmail
[2024-06-14, 5:51:57 PM] Zoe: And you wouldn’t give me a relationship even without the situation
[2024-06-14, 5:52:08 PM] Adam: Of course I wouldn't jump into a relationship

[2024-06-16, 8:35:57 PM] Zoe: Liking Toronto?
[2024-06-16, 11:48:28 PM] Zoe: I realized that I wanted to meet up with you to see if you would see me without trying to be sexual with me… because I was thinking about if I could be in a relationship with you. 
I wanted to see if I would leave Chris for you.
lol 
I enjoyed seeing you anyways. I definitely feel a special warmth in your presence… and a connection. I don’t mean sexual.

Good luck 💪✌️ <This message was edited>

[2024-06-19, 8:06:18 PM] Zoe: I’m not gunna change my position
[2024-06-19, 8:06:38 PM] Adam: Is this your imaginary insurance policy so that you could make sure that your boyfriend doesn't leave you?

[2024-06-21, 12:05:19 PM] Zoe: I get it but I just can’t
[2024-06-21, 12:05:36 PM] Zoe: If you try to understand you might be able to
[2024-06-21, 12:05:44 PM] Adam: Loll I do understand
[2024-06-21, 12:05:47 PM] Adam: And completely get it..
[2024-06-21, 12:05:57 PM] Adam: But I'm leaving for awhile
[2024-06-21, 12:06:15 PM] Zoe: Yeah I know you’re leaving
[2024-06-21, 12:06:17 PM] Adam: Also clearly this isn't harming your relationship..he understands the addiction lol
[2024-06-21, 12:06:25 PM] Adam: He completely gets it
[2024-06-21, 12:06:29 PM] Zoe: But if I can show him
[2024-06-21, 12:06:35 PM] Adam: Show him what ?
[2024-06-21, 12:06:37 PM] Zoe: That I can resist
[2024-06-21, 12:06:45 PM] Zoe: This is all so silly
[2024-06-21, 12:06:53 PM] Adam: Not necessarily...you can easily rationalize it .
[2024-06-21, 12:06:58 PM] Adam: That he's gone and I needed closure
[2024-06-21, 12:07:06 PM] Zoe: And you got closure
[2024-06-21, 12:07:09 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-21, 12:07:12 PM] Adam: I know it's selfish
[2024-06-21, 12:07:16 PM] Zoe: Super
[2024-06-21, 12:07:17 PM] Adam: I just really want to see you again
[2024-06-21, 12:07:21 PM] Zoe: I understand
[2024-06-21, 12:07:29 PM] Adam: Can you think about it ?
[2024-06-21, 12:07:36 PM] Zoe: But for me the healthiest thing is to keep moving on
[2024-06-21, 12:07:48 PM] Adam: Ok move on after I leave 😂😂
[2024-06-21, 12:07:50 PM] Zoe: I can think about it if you tell me where nvidia is going to land
[2024-06-21, 12:07:52 PM] Adam: It was sooo nice
[2024-06-21, 12:07:54 PM] Adam: Last time
[2024-06-21, 12:07:56 PM] Zoe: That’s not fair
[2024-06-21, 12:08:04 PM] Adam: I can definitely tell you
[2024-06-21, 12:08:07 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-21, 12:08:18 PM] Zoe: I bought at 132
[2024-06-21, 12:08:22 PM] Adam: I think they are estimating a $4 to $5 trillion marketcap.
[2024-06-21, 12:08:29 PM] Zoe: I feel like the whole stock market is going to fail
[2024-06-21, 12:08:43 PM] Adam: It might but you're not going wrong with Nvidia
[2024-06-21, 12:08:45 PM] Zoe: How do I guess by that
[2024-06-21, 12:08:53 PM] Zoe: The share price
[2024-06-21, 12:08:59 PM] Adam: It will rise for sure, the entire market right now is bleeding
[2024-06-21, 12:09:09 PM] Adam: But it can rebound in days..
[2024-06-21, 12:09:27 PM] Adam: What I would do personally is wait until Nvidia rises..sell it off..
[2024-06-21, 12:09:28 PM] Zoe: $4 trillion means what though? Share price X amount shares out?
[2024-06-21, 12:09:35 PM] Adam: And wait until it goes below $120
[2024-06-21, 12:09:42 PM] Adam: Could be $150+
[2024-06-21, 12:09:54 PM] Zoe: Sell at 135?
[2024-06-21, 12:10:12 PM] Adam: Yes
[2024-06-21, 12:10:18 PM] Adam: Because it's gonna go down and up again.
[2024-06-21, 12:10:26 PM] Adam: The rule of thumb is to buy when the market is bleeding.
[2024-06-21, 12:10:32 PM] Adam: So right now it's slightly bleeding
[2024-06-21, 12:10:54 PM] Adam: Can I come over next week ?
[2024-06-21, 12:10:58 PM] Adam: 😍
[2024-06-21, 12:11:03 PM] Zoe: Nope
[2024-06-21, 12:11:07 PM] Adam: Lol just to see
[2024-06-21, 12:11:23 PM] Adam: What interesting things you got
[2024-06-21, 12:11:32 PM] Zoe: I’m spending the weekend with Chris
[2024-06-21, 12:11:40 PM] Zoe: We’re doing couple things to repair
[2024-06-21, 12:12:08 PM] Adam: And next week it's us ?
[2024-06-21, 12:12:13 PM] Adam: It was so nice last time lol
[2024-06-21, 12:12:14 PM] Zoe: I’m buying $NIO and $XPEV I like Chinese automotive
[2024-06-21, 12:12:14 PM] Adam: I loved it
[2024-06-21, 12:12:24 PM] Zoe: Good keep it as a memory
[2024-06-21, 12:12:34 PM] Adam: Lol did you feel bad after ?
[2024-06-21, 12:12:36 PM] Adam: Or not really ?
[2024-06-21, 12:12:38 PM] Zoe: Chinese robotics too
[2024-06-21, 12:12:41 PM] Zoe: Uh yeah
[2024-06-21, 12:12:49 PM] Zoe: And I will feel worse as the years go on
[2024-06-21, 12:13:01 PM] Zoe: And I will be concerned that he will do the exact same thing to me
[2024-06-21, 12:13:13 PM] Adam: I want to see you.
[2024-06-21, 12:13:17 PM] Zoe: I think I hurt him and I long term, if he ever takes time to analyze it
[2024-06-21, 12:13:20 PM] Adam: At least on Monday or Tuesday
[2024-06-21, 12:13:35 PM] Zoe: What do you think
[2024-06-21, 12:13:40 PM] Adam: Can we do camping ?
[2024-06-21, 12:13:48 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-21, 12:13:57 PM] Zoe: Robots?
[2024-06-21, 12:14:01 PM] Adam: Stay away
[2024-06-21, 12:14:04 PM] Adam: I wouldn't touch that
[2024-06-21, 12:14:05 PM] Zoe: Awww
[2024-06-21, 12:14:13 PM] Zoe: I’m blowing money :(
[2024-06-21, 12:14:23 PM] Adam: No you're not.
[2024-06-21, 12:14:36 PM] Adam: Look I can help restabilize your portfolio.
[2024-06-21, 12:14:56 PM] Zoe: You wanna say just buy etf
[2024-06-21, 12:14:58 PM] Adam: 50% to 64% of your portfolio should be ETFs
[2024-06-21, 12:15:10 PM] Zoe: I want my 18k back
[2024-06-21, 12:15:14 PM] Adam: So I would slowly start buying VOO
[2024-06-21, 12:15:20 PM] Adam: At least 1 share a month.
[2024-06-21, 12:15:23 PM] Zoe: Why I gotta dca
[2024-06-21, 12:15:34 PM] Adam: ?
[2024-06-21, 12:15:55 PM] Zoe: Oops the other acronym
[2024-06-21, 12:16:08 PM] Zoe: The one where you buy 1 and later buy another
[2024-06-21, 12:16:24 PM] Adam: Average down?
[2024-06-21, 12:16:28 PM] Zoe: Yeah
[2024-06-21, 12:16:34 PM] Adam: Not really for that purpose.
[2024-06-21, 12:16:43 PM] Adam: VOO is an amazing long-term ETF with dividends
[2024-06-21, 12:16:56 PM] Zoe: Why not lump sum now
[2024-06-21, 12:17:01 PM] Zoe: I have so much cash
[2024-06-21, 12:18:00 PM] Adam: After investing $500 a month into VOO for 5 years, assuming an average annual return of 7%, the investment would grow to approximately $35,796.45.

So basically your $15,000 would double.
[2024-06-21, 12:28:01 PM] Adam: And if you do it for 20 years, basically your $120,000 turns into $260,000.
[2024-06-21, 12:28:52 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-21, 12:29:15 PM] Adam: So will you see me ?
[2024-06-21, 12:32:20 PM] Adam: Hmm?
[2024-06-21, 12:41:32 PM] Zoe: The stock market has catfished me
[2024-06-21, 12:41:39 PM] Zoe: No I want to stop all this
[2024-06-21, 12:41:56 PM] Adam: Stop what ?
[2024-06-21, 12:49:07 PM] Zoe: Meeting up, talking
[2024-06-21, 1:02:55 PM] Adam: Why :(
[2024-06-21, 1:02:59 PM] Adam: I want to see you 😍
[2024-06-21, 1:03:11 PM] Zoe: Yeah that’s not enough

[2024-06-21, 1:19:10 PM] Adam: Next weekend
[2024-06-21, 1:19:11 PM] Zoe: I don’t want to create a connection between you and I
[2024-06-21, 1:19:21 PM] Adam: It's not gonna be a permanent connection
[2024-06-21, 1:19:32 PM] Zoe: Oh?
[2024-06-21, 1:19:33 PM] Adam: It'll take a few days for you to forget about me and go back to normal
[2024-06-21, 1:19:44 PM] Zoe: That what you think
[2024-06-21, 1:20:10 PM] Adam: It was amazing last time
[2024-06-21, 1:20:16 PM] Adam: Delicious kiss 😂

[2024-06-21, 1:24:13 PM] Zoe: Why don’t you want a relationship?
[2024-06-21, 1:24:13 PM] Adam: I want to come back and see some cool things
[2024-06-21, 1:24:30 PM] Adam: It's not that I don't want one
[2024-06-21, 1:24:36 PM] Adam: It's that I don't know where I'll be tomorrow...
[2024-06-21, 1:24:39 PM] Adam: I'm just at the phase
[2024-06-21, 1:24:43 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-21, 1:24:45 PM] Adam: If I was back here, I'd definitely want to.

[2024-06-21, 1:26:22 PM] Adam: I can just imagine what will happen if we kiss
[2024-06-21, 1:26:30 PM] Zoe: Won’t happen
[2024-06-21, 1:27:23 PM] Adam: It's happened twice no? 😀
[2024-06-21, 1:33:22 PM] Adam: The second time was way better lol
[2024-06-21, 1:33:25 PM] Adam: Lucious
[2024-06-21, 1:34:24 PM] Zoe: Should I buy $HIMS looks undervalued from financials
[2024-06-21, 1:41:22 PM] Adam: Why don't we kiss ? 😘
[2024-06-21, 1:41:37 PM] Adam: And then I willl never message again 😂
[2024-06-21, 1:44:35 PM] Zoe: Ha ha ha
[2024-06-21, 1:44:42 PM] Zoe: You can only dream of it
[2024-06-21, 1:45:07 PM] Adam: Why? What if I gave $1000 for a kiss 😂
[2024-06-21, 1:47:16 PM] Zoe: Nope
[2024-06-21, 1:47:20 PM] Zoe: ??
[2024-06-21, 1:47:53 PM] Zoe: You like messing with the life I’ve created here?
[2024-06-21, 1:48:04 PM] Adam: No lol I know a kiss won't mess anything lol
[2024-06-21, 1:48:07 PM] Zoe: You know he treats me so well
[2024-06-21, 1:48:11 PM] Zoe: That’s bull
[2024-06-21, 1:48:15 PM] Zoe: You know it would
[2024-06-21, 1:48:20 PM] Adam: He'll think you fell victim to addiction
[2024-06-21, 1:48:29 PM] Zoe: F u
[2024-06-21, 1:48:30 PM] Adam: I guarantee it won't harm anything
[2024-06-21, 1:48:37 PM] Zoe: That’s b.s and we both know it
[2024-06-21, 1:48:38 PM] Adam: I know for a fact he won't leave
[2024-06-21, 1:48:49 PM] Adam: I'm telling you I'd be honest with this and tell the truth
[2024-06-21, 1:48:51 PM] Zoe: He’s kind for putting it in a way that doesn’t hurt him
[2024-06-21, 1:48:54 PM] Adam: I doubt he will leave you.
[2024-06-21, 1:49:05 PM] Zoe: It will hurt us
[2024-06-21, 1:49:11 PM] Adam: He will think that you couldn't handle it
[2024-06-21, 1:49:13 PM] Zoe: I’m going to spend my life with him
[2024-06-21, 1:49:15 PM] Adam: And he will know I left.
[2024-06-21, 1:49:32 PM] Adam: I don't think he will leave.
[2024-06-21, 1:49:46 PM] Adam: I think part of that agreement is him knowing you're also putting up with him
[2024-06-21, 1:49:52 PM] Zoe: See
[2024-06-21, 1:50:00 PM] Zoe: F off

[2024-06-21, 1:50:12 PM] Adam: It's true ? What isn't true about that ?
[2024-06-21, 1:50:18 PM] Adam: You think it's easy to be with someone that has debt
[2024-06-21, 1:50:26 PM] Adam: That has addiction
[2024-06-21, 1:52:19 PM] Zoe: He’s working on everything
[2024-06-21, 1:52:29 PM] Zoe: Look I’m getting my period in 2 days
[2024-06-21, 1:54:08 PM] Adam: So ? What does that have anything to do with it ? I know we would never have sex.
[2024-06-21, 1:54:13 PM] Adam: I just want to kiss you 😘
[2024-06-21, 1:54:35 PM] Zoe: I don’t want to kiss… you don’t want to commit, you don’t get to kiss me
[2024-06-21, 1:54:45 PM] Zoe: Do you think you’ll ever regret it?
[2024-06-21, 1:55:08 PM] Adam: Lol I will commit if the kiss tells me to
[2024-06-21, 1:55:15 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-21, 1:55:17 PM] Zoe: Th
[2024-06-21, 1:55:29 PM] Zoe: Too much danger for me to move from him to you anyways
[2024-06-21, 1:56:11 PM] Zoe: How’s Zanzibar?
[2024-06-21, 1:56:36 PM] Adam: I'm telling you, there is absolutely no way he would leave you if we kissed.. especially since I would be leaving lol...he will understand.
[2024-06-21, 1:56:42 PM] Adam: I know I know...F you...

[2024-06-21, 4:30:37 PM] Adam: I'll stop.
[2024-06-21, 4:30:39 PM] Adam: Fine.
[2024-06-21, 4:30:43 PM] Zoe: No you won’t!
[2024-06-21, 4:30:50 PM] Adam: Stopping nown
[2024-06-21, 4:30:58 PM] Zoe: For what, 2 minutes?
[2024-06-21, 4:31:10 PM] Adam: No awhile
[2024-06-21, 4:57:56 PM] Zoe: Chris has made crazy advancements this week in his job.. they want him to be the ai architect
[2024-06-21, 4:58:06 PM] Zoe: Did I mention that he’s very talented in programming
[2024-06-21, 4:58:13 PM] Zoe: The thing is
[2024-06-21, 4:58:23 PM] Zoe: He’s gunna realize I’ve wrong him
[2024-06-21, 4:58:30 PM] Zoe: When he gets his ego inflated
[2024-06-21, 4:58:37 PM] Zoe: So should I leave him?
[2024-06-21, 4:58:54 PM] Zoe: I’m so confused now
[2024-06-21, 4:59:10 PM] Zoe: You’re just this fleeting thing
[2024-06-21, 4:59:21 PM] Zoe: And youve really stirred up my life
[2024-06-21, 4:59:41 PM] Zoe: And I am getting my period so I’m going to be very emotional for a while
[2024-06-21, 5:01:21 PM] Adam: Lol honestly you seem to think people behave according to how they feel about themselves or what advancements they've made..
[2024-06-21, 5:01:51 PM] Adam: If he was going to leave you because his ego got inflated, then that's not someone you want to spend your life with..
[2024-06-21, 5:02:06 PM] Zoe: Fair
[2024-06-21, 5:02:19 PM] Adam: People don't leave because they have self-confidence.
[2024-06-21, 5:02:30 PM] Adam: That's the wildest thing I've heard lol....
[2024-06-21, 5:02:33 PM] Zoe: But now I don’t understand why he stays.. he can clearly see I have feelings for you
[2024-06-21, 5:02:45 PM] Adam: Because I'm not a threat ?
[2024-06-21, 5:02:47 PM] Adam: I'm leaving ?
[2024-06-21, 5:02:49 PM] Zoe: But that’s sad… I don’t want him to have low confidence and that’s why he’s with me
[2024-06-21, 5:03:02 PM] Adam: You want to leave him ?
[2024-06-21, 5:03:06 PM] Adam: ?
[2024-06-21, 5:03:19 PM] Zoe: I don’t know what I want
[2024-06-21, 5:03:27 PM] Zoe: I’ve been seeing you lately so I’m confused
[2024-06-21, 5:03:31 PM] Zoe: That’s why no good
[2024-06-21, 5:03:33 PM] Zoe: To see you
[2024-06-21, 5:03:52 PM] Zoe: You don’t care about my feelings though… you can’t be certain that I will forget
[2024-06-21, 5:04:43 PM] Adam: I'm very certain you'll move on.
[2024-06-21, 5:04:53 PM] Zoe: From you
[2024-06-21, 5:04:57 PM] Zoe: And I won’t care
[2024-06-21, 5:05:00 PM] Zoe: ?
[2024-06-21, 5:05:06 PM] Zoe: I won’t hold anything?
[2024-06-21, 5:05:19 PM] Zoe: My fear is that I get Alzheimer’s and I only remember you
[2024-06-21, 5:05:26 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-21, 5:05:37 PM] Adam: No you won't, at some point I'll leave and your life will take over and you will move forward with him..
[2024-06-21, 5:05:54 PM] Adam: There's no way you'll hang on... especially since I'm oceans away
[2024-06-21, 5:06:04 PM] Adam: This is why I say let's meet up because it's just temporary...
[2024-06-21, 5:06:22 PM] Adam: Chris isn't going to leave you because of me...that won't be the reason.
[2024-06-21, 5:06:59 PM] Adam: Look at the whole grinding thing, it happened days ago and it's already forgotten...
[2024-06-21, 5:07:25 PM] Zoe: I didn’t tell him that
[2024-06-21, 5:07:39 PM] Adam: I'm saying between you and I..
[2024-06-21, 5:07:44 PM] Adam: His main concern is sex..
[2024-06-21, 5:07:53 PM] Adam: I think that's where he draws the line.
[2024-06-21, 5:08:02 PM] Zoe: This is cold and calculated
[2024-06-21, 5:08:10 PM] Zoe: While I trod on his feelings
[2024-06-21, 5:08:15 PM] Adam: What is ?
[2024-06-21, 5:08:34 PM] Zoe: You saying I should play within the limits
[2024-06-21, 5:08:47 PM] Zoe: I care for his feelings
[2024-06-21, 5:08:51 PM] Adam: Absolutely not lol, I am saying there are limits..
[2024-06-21, 5:09:07 PM] Adam: His limit is sex..he probably won't forgive there but I genuinely think he understands why you go back and forth..
[2024-06-21, 5:10:22 PM] Adam: If he was crying and angry and upset and disappointed then I'd get why you're trying to avoid it..
[2024-06-21, 5:10:30 PM] Adam: But he isn't displaying severe signs of being hurt lol..
[2024-06-21, 5:10:33 PM] Zoe: He did cry
[2024-06-21, 5:10:38 PM] Zoe: Multiple times
[2024-06-21, 5:10:46 PM] Adam: Because he normally does cry lol..
[2024-06-21, 5:10:52 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-21, 5:11:05 PM] Adam: How is it cold and calculated?
[2024-06-21, 5:11:16 PM] Adam: What gurnatee do you have he won't leave tomorrow..?
[2024-06-21, 5:11:22 PM] Adam: You don't have that guarantee.
[2024-06-21, 5:11:35 PM] Zoe: I don’t anymore… and now I’ve made the relationship unstable
[2024-06-21, 5:12:27 PM] Adam: Let's stay within the limits..
[2024-06-21, 5:12:30 PM] Adam: Sex isn't going to happen.
[2024-06-21, 5:13:12 PM] Zoe: That’s a gambling slogan. Know your limits, play within it. That’s what this feels like, gambling. Will Chris ever forgive me
[2024-06-21, 5:13:31 PM] Adam: If you know for sure
[2024-06-21, 5:13:32 PM] Zoe: Please hire a GFE hooker
[2024-06-21, 5:13:36 PM] Adam: That he won't leave you and he won't be upset.
[2024-06-21, 5:13:42 PM] Adam: Would you and I make out?
[2024-06-21, 5:13:46 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-21, 5:13:51 PM] Zoe: I don’t trust you
[2024-06-21, 5:13:55 PM] Adam: If you knew 100%
[2024-06-21, 5:14:35 PM] Adam: What if you knew..not from me.
[2024-06-21, 5:14:40 PM] Zoe: You’re asking me if I’m polyamorous
[2024-06-21, 5:14:46 PM] Adam: No
[2024-06-21, 5:14:50 PM] Adam: Absolutely not.
[2024-06-21, 5:14:54 PM] Zoe: Why did that statement from all those years ago come back to bite me
[2024-06-21, 5:15:22 PM] Adam: Which one ?
[2024-06-21, 5:15:41 PM] Zoe: Whatever makes you think I don’t want to be monogamous
[2024-06-21, 5:15:47 PM] Zoe: Something I said
[2024-06-21, 5:15:49 PM] Zoe: I don’t know
[2024-06-21, 5:15:52 PM] Adam: It's nothing to do with that..
[2024-06-21, 5:15:57 PM] Adam: I am not someone new.
[2024-06-21, 5:16:08 PM] Adam: I am someone in the past..which means I have reserved feelings.
[2024-06-21, 5:16:15 PM] Adam: New ones weren't created while you were with Chris
[2024-06-21, 5:16:24 PM] Zoe: Lots of people don’t like their exes
[2024-06-21, 5:16:32 PM] Adam: Old ones revived..it doesn't mean it's polyamorous
[2024-06-21, 5:16:46 PM] Adam: It's just old feelings..
[2024-06-21, 5:17:12 PM] Adam: We already pecked and somewhat kissed
[2024-06-21, 5:17:17 PM] Zoe: wtf
[2024-06-21, 5:17:18 PM] Adam: It's not the end of the world absolutely not
[2024-06-21, 5:17:27 PM] Adam: Your relationship didn't suddenly die out
[2024-06-21, 5:17:31 PM] Adam: It's a kiss for God's sake
[2024-06-21, 5:17:32 PM] Adam: Not sex.
[2024-06-21, 5:19:28 PM] Adam: So
[2024-06-21, 5:20:19 PM] Zoe: Look if I lose Chris because of you
[2024-06-21, 5:20:27 PM] Zoe: I won’t have him or you
[2024-06-21, 5:20:33 PM] Zoe: Why can’t you stop playing
[2024-06-21, 5:20:42 PM] Adam: You can have me, deal ?
[2024-06-21, 5:20:47 PM] Zoe: I can’t!
[2024-06-21, 5:20:56 PM] Zoe: You will play me like this
[2024-06-21, 5:20:58 PM] Zoe: Forever
[2024-06-21, 5:21:04 PM] Zoe: I think
[2024-06-21, 5:21:09 PM] Adam: Not at all.
[2024-06-21, 5:21:25 PM] Zoe: Look I’m very emotional 2-3 days before period
[2024-06-21, 5:21:31 PM] Zoe: Best to avoid me right now
[2024-06-21, 5:22:00 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-21, 5:22:12 PM] Adam: It's the perfect sex blocker
[2024-06-21, 5:22:15 PM] Adam: Nothing can happen!
[2024-06-21, 5:24:04 PM] Adam: Hmm

[2024-06-21, 5:42:27 PM] Adam: Hmm
[2024-06-21, 5:42:58 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-21, 5:43:05 PM] Zoe: Spending weekend with Chris
[2024-06-21, 5:43:15 PM] Zoe: I’m taking a break from you this weekend at least
[2024-06-21, 5:46:54 PM] Adam: Can I get kisses after
[2024-06-21, 5:57:13 PM] Adam: Hmm
[2024-06-22, 2:08:32 PM] Adam: Hey

[2024-06-22, 5:11:16 PM] Zoe: With Chris spending time
[2024-06-22, 5:11:25 PM] Zoe: You?
[2024-06-22, 10:11:44 PM] Adam: Hope it's going well
[2024-06-22, 10:22:09 PM] Zoe: It is :)
[2024-06-22, 10:22:15 PM] Zoe: Surprisingly
[2024-06-22, 10:24:36 PM] Zoe: Hope you’re doing well
[2024-06-23, 4:42:59 AM] Adam: Amazing to hear :)
[2024-06-23, 12:24:18 PM] Adam: You still with him ?
[2024-06-23, 12:51:09 PM] Zoe: Yeah
[2024-06-23, 12:57:57 PM] Adam: Oo
[2024-06-23, 12:58:08 PM] Adam: Sleeping over
[2024-06-23, 2:29:49 PM] Zoe: Yup
[2024-06-23, 11:57:59 PM] Adam: Noice
[2024-06-23, 11:58:09 PM] Adam: So am I getting blocked ?
[2024-06-24, 4:42:59 AM] Zoe: Yeah that makes sense
[2024-06-24, 4:43:08 AM] Zoe: Since you’re leaving
[2024-06-24, 7:40:53 AM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-24, 7:41:19 AM] Adam: So did y'all makeup and have sex?
[2024-06-24, 7:54:10 AM] Zoe: Yes we did.
[2024-06-24, 7:56:52 AM] Adam: Oo
[2024-06-24, 7:56:58 AM] Adam: Was it good
[2024-06-24, 7:57:17 AM] Zoe: It was okay
[2024-06-24, 7:57:37 AM] Adam: Feel like that's your version of bad
[2024-06-24, 7:58:02 AM] Adam: Did you want sex?
[2024-06-24, 7:59:21 AM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-24, 7:59:47 AM] Adam: So why did you go through with it..
[2024-06-24, 8:00:04 AM] Zoe: Foreplay gets me…
[2024-06-24, 8:00:22 AM] Adam: Thought it was nonexistent with you guys..
[2024-06-24, 8:00:47 AM] Zoe: Thanks for giving him reasons to want me?
[2024-06-24, 8:00:56 AM] Adam: Huh
[2024-06-24, 8:01:14 AM] Zoe: That sounds strange
[2024-06-24, 8:01:17 AM] Zoe: It’s not you
[2024-06-24, 8:01:19 AM] Adam: By foreplay you mean kissing?
[2024-06-24, 8:01:40 AM] Zoe: It’s just when he thinks I’m resisting I think it turns him on
[2024-06-24, 8:01:46 AM] Zoe: Yes and grinding
[2024-06-24, 8:01:52 AM] Adam: Weird
[2024-06-24, 8:02:02 AM] Zoe: Anyways
[2024-06-24, 8:02:25 AM] Adam: So now you're definitely not meeting up with me eh
[2024-06-24, 8:03:17 AM] Zoe: I wouldn’t do anything with you. I don’t see why you would want to meet up.
[2024-06-24, 8:03:40 AM] Adam: Can I come over ? 😁
[2024-06-24, 8:04:16 AM] Zoe: Noooo
[2024-06-24, 8:04:21 AM] Zoe: Sorry.
[2024-06-24, 8:04:36 AM] Adam: Why
[2024-06-24, 8:04:41 AM] Adam: Nothing is gonna happen
[2024-06-24, 8:04:47 AM] Zoe: I know.
[2024-06-24, 8:04:50 AM] Adam: And I'm pretty sure he doesn't care
[2024-06-24, 8:05:00 AM] Adam: He doesn't seem to mind
[2024-06-24, 8:05:20 AM] Zoe: I know he cares
[2024-06-24, 8:05:28 AM] Zoe: He told me he doesn’t want me to see you
[2024-06-24, 8:05:39 AM] Zoe: And then he’s planned our future in the same sitting
[2024-06-24, 8:05:40 AM] Zoe: lol
[2024-06-24, 8:05:48 AM] Adam: See...
[2024-06-24, 8:06:10 AM] Adam: I guess he just understans
[2024-06-24, 8:06:29 AM] Adam: Lol take advantage of the free hall pass 😂
[2024-06-24, 8:06:48 AM] Zoe: Noooo I don’t want to have anything on my conscience
[2024-06-24, 8:07:07 AM] Adam: You won't have anything on your conscience...it's impossible..
[2024-06-24, 8:07:12 AM] Adam: Nothing will happen or go down ..
[2024-06-24, 8:07:25 AM] Zoe: I don’t want to be kissed
[2024-06-24, 8:07:28 AM] Adam: We'd be hanging out.
[2024-06-24, 8:07:36 AM] Zoe: I feel bad bringing you in my house
[2024-06-24, 8:07:37 AM] Adam: Order food
[2024-06-24, 8:07:40 AM] Zoe: Where he’s lived
[2024-06-24, 8:07:41 AM] Adam: And then I go home.
[2024-06-24, 8:08:15 AM] Adam: There's nothing to feel bad about though, nothing will happen..no kissing or hugging or anything..
[2024-06-24, 8:08:38 AM] Adam: We can order food and watch some TV and call it a day
[2024-06-24, 8:09:57 AM] Zoe: Why do you want to come over?
[2024-06-24, 8:12:42 AM] Adam: Idk just to hangout, chat, you can show me interesting things ?
[2024-06-24, 8:13:04 AM] Adam: I don't want anything else..won't even touch you...
[2024-06-24, 8:16:59 AM] Zoe: I don’t feel comfortable having you in my home. It’s not that I don’t like you. I don’t feel comfortable because of Chris, and for previous reasons of you not letting me in yours.
[2024-06-24, 8:20:30 AM] Adam: I get the whole Chris thing but nothing is going to happen ...and it doesn't make a difference whether it's inside or outside..
[2024-06-24, 8:21:00 AM] Adam: As for the past, I can't undo that..wish I could.
[2024-06-24, 8:21:26 AM] Adam: He will obviously not like the idea of you seeing me inside or out ..
[2024-06-24, 8:21:49 AM] Adam: I just want to be indoors and I want to see the cool things you've got 😁
[2024-06-24, 8:22:00 AM] Zoe: There’s nothing cool here lol
[2024-06-24, 8:22:11 AM] Adam: I mean a candy machine is cool.
[2024-06-24, 8:22:17 AM] Zoe: I broke it
[2024-06-24, 8:22:22 AM] Adam: We'll order food as well.
[2024-06-24, 8:22:27 AM] Adam: Maybe we can fix it !
[2024-06-24, 8:22:30 AM] Adam: Perfect distraction
[2024-06-24, 8:22:43 AM] Zoe: I misplaced the piece that fixes it
[2024-06-24, 8:22:57 AM] Adam: We'll look for them
[2024-06-24, 8:23:07 AM] Zoe: I’m not sure if it’s here or at my mothers
[2024-06-24, 8:23:37 AM] Adam: Whatever it is ... nothing will happen..and it makes no difference where we are.
[2024-06-24, 8:24:13 AM] Adam: Trust me, you're saying you feel bad now but once I'm inside and we're hanging out, it won't feel bad..
[2024-06-24, 8:24:44 AM] Zoe: Oh I do feel bad for the cumulative times I see you
[2024-06-24, 8:24:54 AM] Zoe: And I know he’s planning a future for us
[2024-06-24, 8:25:02 AM] Zoe: And talking about having kids
[2024-06-24, 8:25:06 AM] Adam: That planning won't stop lol..
[2024-06-24, 8:25:16 AM] Zoe: Sure but it distracts my mind
[2024-06-24, 8:25:20 AM] Adam: He doesn't seem to mind, he understands.
[2024-06-24, 8:25:29 AM] Zoe: I don’t want us to have any good times
[2024-06-24, 8:25:31 AM] Adam: For now long? I'll be gone anyway?
[2024-06-24, 8:25:50 AM] Zoe: Yeah I don’t want to meet
[2024-06-24, 8:25:53 AM] Adam: Even if we did, you'll likely forget it and move on.
[2024-06-24, 8:26:15 AM] Adam: But at least we get to enjoy the moment of it...I want to see you...
[2024-06-24, 8:27:04 AM] Adam: Can I drop by for a bit around 11 ?
[2024-06-24, 8:27:22 AM] Adam: Just for a bit, I need to leave after as well to fix my car window
[2024-06-24, 8:28:57 AM] Zoe: 11pm?
[2024-06-24, 8:29:07 AM] Adam: AM

[2024-06-24, 8:42:56 AM] Adam: It's perfect
[2024-06-24, 8:43:02 AM] Zoe: I don’t feel comfortable
[2024-06-24, 8:43:06 AM] Zoe: Having you over
[2024-06-24, 8:43:14 AM] Adam: It's actually perfect though because I can't stay for long
[2024-06-24, 8:43:18 AM] Adam: Just like last time
[2024-06-24, 8:43:21 AM] Adam: In and out
[2024-06-24, 8:53:22 AM] Zoe: How long would you stay
[2024-06-24, 8:53:28 AM] Zoe: Thought you said ordering food
[2024-06-24, 9:00:38 AM] Adam: We could order lunch ?
[2024-06-24, 9:00:41 AM] Adam: I'm happy with that
[2024-06-24, 9:01:12 AM] Zoe: I don’t feel comfortable sorry
[2024-06-24, 9:01:52 AM] Adam: How about this
[2024-06-24, 9:02:00 AM] Adam: Let me stand by the door and we can talk about it
[2024-06-24, 9:02:06 AM] Adam: If you're not comfortable I'll leave.
[2024-06-24, 9:02:11 AM] Adam: I won't stay for long
[2024-06-24, 9:02:26 AM] Zoe: And if you come in you stay at the door?
[2024-06-24, 9:02:31 AM] Adam: Yes
[2024-06-24, 9:02:36 AM] Adam: We can have a conversation
[2024-06-24, 9:02:39 AM] Zoe: Ugh
[2024-06-24, 9:02:40 AM] Adam: If you're not comfortable I'll go.
[2024-06-24, 9:02:58 AM] Zoe: I’m already uncomfortable
[2024-06-24, 9:03:04 AM] Adam: Let's just try it and see.
[2024-06-24, 9:03:06 AM] Adam: No promises.

[2024-06-24, 2:26:36 PM] Zoe: But also I don’t think I’ll see you again before you leave. I don’t need to form these memories
[2024-06-24, 2:26:49 PM] Zoe: I think you will understand
[2024-06-24, 2:27:06 PM] Zoe: Peace is the Middle East. Enjoy Africa for me.
[2024-06-24, 2:33:43 PM] Adam: You blocked this contact
[2024-06-24, 2:34:02 PM] Adam: You unblocked this contact
[2024-06-24, 2:38:40 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-06-24, 2:38:52 PM] Adam: Can I see you in a bitn
[2024-06-24, 2:38:55 PM] Adam: 😁
[2024-06-24, 2:39:03 PM] Adam: I'll come after they repair the window haha
[2024-06-24, 4:24:55 PM] Adam: Hmm
[2024-06-24, 4:33:26 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-06-24, 4:33:37 PM] Zoe: It’s been nice, but this has messed with my head
[2024-06-24, 4:33:47 PM] Zoe: I don’t think I’m worthy of Chris now
[2024-06-24, 4:34:32 PM] Zoe: I think I have justified seeing you by many different things
[2024-06-24, 4:34:44 PM] Zoe: But if I wanted to try to repair my relationship
[2024-06-24, 4:34:52 PM] Zoe: I should have just stayed away from you
[2024-06-24, 4:35:35 PM] Adam: I think you're making it a bigger deal than it is
[2024-06-24, 4:35:52 PM] Zoe: I have to think about my motivations
[2024-06-24, 4:36:02 PM] Zoe: And my loyalty
[2024-06-24, 4:36:28 PM] Zoe: It’s easier for you to say because you don’t have someone that you could potentially mess something up with
[2024-06-24, 4:39:15 PM] Zoe: And something you don’t know.. because you don’t know everything. 

He actually blocked me and told his family he broke up with me half a week ago after he found out I saw you
[2024-06-24, 4:39:19 PM] Zoe: He does care
[2024-06-24, 4:39:23 PM] Zoe: And I’m spiralling
[2024-06-24, 4:39:36 PM] Zoe: Maybe I don’t like him, maybe I am fucked
[2024-06-24, 4:40:03 PM] Zoe: You want to fuck me? You already fucked my mind today.
[2024-06-24, 4:41:09 PM] Adam: I think you need to take a moment to realize just how emotional you are being right now
[2024-06-24, 4:41:23 PM] Adam: You are on your period
[2024-06-24, 4:41:35 PM] Zoe: 🤬
[2024-06-24, 4:41:45 PM] Adam: Give your mind a break

[2024-06-26, 10:03:02 PM] Adam: In fact, you've had sex with him..
[2024-06-26, 10:03:34 PM] Adam: If he was remotely bothered by you seeing me he wouldn't have sex with you, he wouldn't see you and he would be ignoring you...
[2024-06-26, 10:03:45 PM] Adam: So there's literally 0 damage from seeing me
[2024-06-26, 10:05:22 PM] Zoe: No point in seeing each other

[2024-06-26, 10:07:18 PM] Zoe: I’m good
[2024-06-26, 10:07:23 PM] Zoe: No thanks
[2024-06-26, 10:08:02 PM] Zoe: I understand getting coffee with an old friend
[2024-06-26, 10:08:29 PM] Zoe: But you’re trying to get boyfriend status things without being a boyfriend
[2024-06-26, 10:09:37 PM] Adam: GIF omitted
[2024-06-26, 10:11:44 PM] Zoe: You’ll have ladies lined up who actually want that
[2024-06-26, 10:11:52 PM] Zoe: You’re a catch
[2024-06-26, 10:11:54 PM] Adam: Sadly
[2024-06-26, 10:11:56 PM] Adam: You want it
[2024-06-26, 10:11:59 PM] Adam: But can't admit it
[2024-06-26, 10:12:05 PM] Adam: You're like in this twilight zone
[2024-06-26, 10:12:14 PM] Adam: Wish you can admit it
[2024-06-26, 10:13:00 PM] Zoe: Is this what you think of every woman who turns you down?
[2024-06-26, 10:13:09 PM] Adam: No definitely not every woman
[2024-06-26, 10:13:12 PM] Adam: I know for a fact
[2024-06-26, 10:13:15 PM] Adam: You think it's hot

[2024-06-26, 10:13:27 PM] Adam: I know that for sure
[2024-06-26, 10:13:40 PM] Adam: Denying it may save you from never having to admit to it
[2024-06-26, 10:13:45 PM] Adam: But I definitely know the truth lol
[2024-06-26, 10:14:00 PM] Adam: If you were single, I'd probably have cum inside of you 5 times
[2024-06-26, 10:14:14 PM] Adam: GIF omitted
[2024-06-26, 10:14:21 PM] Zoe: You’d give a girl you weren’t seeing a baby?
[2024-06-26, 10:14:23 PM] Zoe: Why?
[2024-06-26, 10:14:30 PM] Adam: Why can't you admit
[2024-06-26, 10:14:35 PM] Adam: It's hot
[2024-06-26, 10:14:42 PM] Adam: And you would enjoy it if it weren't for Chris ?
[2024-06-26, 10:15:01 PM] Zoe: You’re cray
[2024-06-26, 10:15:08 PM] Adam: Admit it lol

[2024-06-26, 10:15:17 PM] Adam: Basically
[2024-06-26, 10:15:27 PM] Adam: I see the way you look at me
[2024-06-26, 10:15:39 PM] Adam: And you've said it yourself
[2024-06-26, 10:15:43 PM] Adam: "If I was single..."
[2024-06-26, 10:18:48 PM] Zoe: Oh well
[2024-06-26, 10:18:58 PM] Adam: So

[2024-06-26, 11:57:47 PM] Adam: So you said you like lovemaking not fucking
[2024-06-26, 11:57:49 PM] Adam: That's not true
[2024-06-26, 11:58:04 PM] Zoe: Cause you and I could never make love
[2024-06-26, 11:58:10 PM] Adam: You would love it if Chris fucked you from behind in a bathroom stall at a restaurant
[2024-06-26, 11:58:12 PM] Zoe: We could never slow down to appreciate each other
[2024-06-26, 11:58:12 PM] Adam: Wouldn't you ?
[2024-06-26, 11:58:18 PM] Zoe: We could never feel each other
[2024-06-26, 11:58:33 PM] Zoe: We never cared for each others pleasure
[2024-06-26, 11:58:35 PM] Adam: What about the school ?
[2024-06-26, 11:58:39 PM] Zoe: We had a loooong way to go

[2024-06-26, 11:58:41 PM] Adam: ?*
[2024-06-26, 11:58:59 PM] Adam: Remember how slow that was ?
[2024-06-26, 11:59:03 PM] Adam: You're not being truthful
[2024-06-26, 11:59:16 PM] Adam: Because you'd much rather sex like this
[2024-06-26, 11:59:18 PM] Adam: Than slow
[2024-06-26, 11:59:29 PM] Zoe: You’re not right
[2024-06-26, 11:59:34 PM] Zoe: Good night
[2024-06-26, 11:59:40 PM] Adam: So let me ask you
[2024-06-26, 11:59:47 PM] Adam: Do you prefer Chris to go slow
[2024-06-26, 11:59:52 PM] Adam: Or do you prefer he fucks you ?
[2024-06-27, 12:01:01 AM] Zoe: Night
[2024-06-27, 12:01:10 AM] Zoe: Stop frustrating yourself
[2024-06-27, 12:01:14 AM] Zoe: Get a gf
[2024-06-27, 12:01:18 AM] Adam: 🖕
[2024-06-27, 12:01:21 AM] Adam: Why don't you block me
[2024-06-27, 12:01:26 AM] Adam: And enjoy your life with your bf
[2024-06-27, 12:01:34 AM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-06-27, 12:01:41 AM] Adam: You blocked this contact
[2024-07-03, 2:15:13 PM] Adam: You unblocked this contact
[2024-07-03, 2:15:33 PM] Zoe: When did you leave?
[2024-07-03, 2:15:42 PM] Zoe: Are you happy to be home?
[2024-07-03, 2:15:55 PM] Zoe: Do you miss Ottawa?
[2024-07-03, 2:16:00 PM] Zoe: And
[2024-07-03, 2:16:02 PM] Zoe: A few things…
When are you going to Africa? 
I can’t believe how much Tesla is up.. you said to buy it at $170… I waited it never got there and only went up 🤦🏻‍♀️
And then I didn’t buy the PANW when you said to too…
Any thing else I should be looking at? I’m watching the Nancy pelosi stocks like you showed me..
At least Chinese EV stocks seem to be getting a boost (I averaged down) 
I dunno what I was thinking but I bought 2k Qualcomm a while ago… how’s the outlook for it? 
What if I bought a condo in the glebe… looking at the one in front of Lansdowne for $600k. I could Airbnb it? Furnish it with buy nothing. Saw someone else doing $200 a night and Airbnb said it was fully booked. I’d buy a cottage nearby but I’m not sure how well I could manage it…

[2024-07-03, 2:23:53 PM] Adam: I know you were dying to give one
[2024-07-03, 2:24:00 PM] Adam: I definitely know you are sexually attracted to me
[2024-07-03, 2:24:03 PM] Adam: And if he wasn't around

Any thing else I should be looking at? I’m watching the Nancy pelosi stocks like you showed me..
[2024-07-03, 2:25:33 PM] Adam: Lol why don't you say no ?
[2024-07-03, 2:25:34 PM] Zoe: At least Chinese EV stocks seem to be getting a boost (I averaged down) 
I dunno what I was thinking but I bought 2k Qualcomm a while ago… how’s the outlook for it?
[2024-07-03, 2:25:37 PM] Adam: If I am not right ?
[2024-07-03, 2:25:43 PM] Adam: Why leave it open-ended
[2024-07-03, 2:25:44 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-07-03, 2:25:45 PM] Zoe: What if I bought a condo in the glebe… looking at the one in front of Lansdowne for $600k. I could Airbnb it? Furnish it with buy nothing.

[2024-07-03, 2:25:55 PM] Zoe: Sorry for confusing you
[2024-07-03, 2:26:22 PM] Zoe: I wouldn’t just have sex with you because I’m out of a relationship. I need commitment

[2024-07-03, 2:30:49 PM] Zoe: An you answer me, please
[2024-07-03, 2:31:47 PM] Adam: I will answer you, it's multiple questions
[2024-07-03, 2:32:23 PM] Adam: But I want to know would we have at least gone to 3rd base
[2024-07-03, 2:32:38 PM] Zoe: Just kissed probably
[2024-07-03, 2:32:49 PM] Zoe: I’d still want a commitment
[2024-07-03, 2:32:58 PM] Zoe: Why you being a fuckboi
[2024-07-03, 2:33:18 PM] Zoe: Obviously you don’t want to comitt so don’t fault me for also not wanting to kiss
[2024-07-03, 2:33:17 PM] Adam: Would you have allowed me to touch you ?
[2024-07-03, 2:33:21 PM] Adam: I want to know these things
[2024-07-03, 2:33:35 PM] Zoe: Does this make sense to you
[2024-07-03, 2:33:41 PM] Adam: Like when I asked to kiss your boobs would that have happened
[2024-07-03, 2:33:43 PM] Adam: That's not sex
[2024-07-03, 2:33:50 PM] Zoe: Why would I find you attractive that way if you don’t find me attractive enough to comitt to
[2024-07-03, 2:34:02 PM] Adam: Would you have let me ?
[2024-07-03, 2:34:09 PM] Zoe: …
[2024-07-03, 2:34:13 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-07-03, 2:34:28 PM] Zoe: Can you answer
[2024-07-03, 2:34:39 PM] Zoe: This
[2024-07-03, 2:34:44 PM] Zoe: And did
[2024-07-03, 2:34:53 PM] Zoe: And this
[2024-07-03, 2:39:35 PM] Zoe: You deleted this message.
[2024-07-03, 2:40:01 PM] Adam: Eating
[2024-07-03, 2:40:09 PM] Zoe: Ok sorry lol
[2024-07-03, 2:41:14 PM] Zoe: Also outlook on $bfm 😁
[2024-07-03, 2:47:24 PM] Adam: Would you have made out with me ?
[2024-07-03, 2:47:30 PM] Adam: At your place when I was there
[2024-07-03, 2:47:34 PM] Adam: Assuming he wasn't in your life
[2024-07-03, 2:48:28 PM] Zoe: I can’t tell you to be honest. I always wanted to leave you because you weren’t giving me enough… so I can’t imagine a life where we were
[2024-07-03, 2:48:45 PM] Zoe: It’s a big hang up
[2024-07-03, 2:48:47 PM] Adam: But I mean same emotions and feelings when I was at your place
[2024-07-03, 2:48:53 PM] Zoe: Can you answer me :(
[2024-07-03, 2:48:58 PM] Adam: Yes but I want to know
[2024-07-03, 2:49:03 PM] Zoe: I liked looking in your eyes
[2024-07-03, 2:49:03 PM] Adam: Would we have kissed
[2024-07-03, 2:49:10 PM] Zoe: And I find them captivating
[2024-07-03, 2:49:16 PM] Zoe: How about that as an answer
[2024-07-03, 2:49:17 PM] Adam: And would that have led to kissing ?
[2024-07-03, 2:49:22 PM] Zoe: I don’t know
[2024-07-03, 2:49:31 PM] Adam: Ok what do you want answered
[2024-07-03, 2:49:46 PM] Zoe: This one!
[2024-07-03, 2:49:56 PM] Zoe: This one!
[2024-07-03, 2:50:05 PM] Zoe: This one!
[2024-07-03, 2:50:10 PM] Zoe: And if you’re going to Africa
[2024-07-03, 2:50:19 PM] Zoe: And maybe the outlook for $bfm
[2024-07-03, 2:50:42 PM] Adam: You need to find out how to get into options..just setup the account and I can help you..
[2024-07-03, 2:51:01 PM] Zoe: That’s not an answer :(
[2024-07-03, 2:51:01 PM] Adam: It's less risk and it's stable.
[2024-07-03, 2:51:04 PM] Zoe: But ok
[2024-07-03, 2:51:22 PM] Adam: I'm answering, I'm saying you don't need to wait for a price to go up or down
[2024-07-03, 2:51:26 PM] Zoe: Ok
[2024-07-03, 2:51:25 PM] Adam: Buy a call option
[2024-07-03, 2:51:44 PM] Zoe: You guys have us stock purchasers in the rat race
[2024-07-03, 2:51:51 PM] Zoe: That’s capital gains though right?
[2024-07-03, 2:53:33 PM] Zoe: Outside of tfsa
[2024-07-03, 3:06:23 PM] Zoe: You didn’t answer my questions :(
[2024-07-03, 3:06:42 PM] Zoe: Probably busy, or just don’t want to provide input?
[2024-07-03, 3:10:25 PM] Adam: I'm not sure how call options work with TFSA, I think it's a quick Google search to see if it works
[2024-07-03, 3:10:48 PM] Adam: I would suggest going with options when trading stocks as you don't need to leverage as much fashb
[2024-07-03, 3:10:51 PM] Adam: Cash
[2024-07-03, 3:10:55 PM] Adam: You also lower your risk.
[2024-07-03, 3:11:11 PM] Zoe: Why arent more people doing it
[2024-07-03, 3:11:30 PM] Adam: I don't know what that is honestly...your best bet is spending at least a few doing due diligence before purchasing a stock.
[2024-07-03, 3:11:58 PM] Zoe: Yes that’s my new way
[2024-07-03, 3:12:12 PM] Adam: Not a good idea to buy something like that to Airbnb...
[2024-07-03, 3:12:24 PM] Adam: Your summers are probably good but I imagine winters suck
[2024-07-03, 3:12:42 PM] Zoe: Ah but winters are better in cottage, or it rents out for more which averages out <This message was edited>
[2024-07-03, 3:12:56 PM] Adam: Yea definitely, especially with a hot tub
[2024-07-03, 3:13:01 PM] Adam: It'll definitely be rented out
[2024-07-03, 3:14:33 PM] Adam: So tell me
[2024-07-03, 3:14:45 PM] Adam: Would you have let me kiss you
[2024-07-03, 3:20:00 PM] Adam: Hmm
[2024-07-03, 3:20:18 PM] Zoe: I didn’t get good answers… barely in depth
[2024-07-03, 3:20:20 PM] Zoe: When’s Africa
[2024-07-03, 3:20:29 PM] Adam: How much depth do you want ?
[2024-07-03, 3:20:30 PM] Zoe: I don’t know
[2024-07-03, 3:20:34 PM] Zoe: I dunno
[2024-07-03, 3:20:48 PM] Adam: What else do you want to know in depth ?
[2024-07-03, 3:20:57 PM] Zoe: When you going to Africa
[2024-07-03, 3:21:17 PM] Adam: Probably in a week or so..
[2024-07-03, 3:21:21 PM] Adam: Maybe next week.
[2024-07-03, 3:21:27 PM] Zoe: And how many girls are you talking to now?
[2024-07-03, 3:21:35 PM] Adam: Lol?
[2024-07-03, 3:21:38 PM] Zoe: Out of curiosity
[2024-07-03, 3:21:48 PM] Adam: Tell me this
[2024-07-03, 3:21:53 PM] Zoe: ?
[2024-07-03, 3:23:23 PM] Adam: I want to know
[2024-07-03, 3:23:26 PM] Adam: No idks
[2024-07-03, 3:23:31 PM] Zoe: I want to buy a cottage
[2024-07-03, 3:23:32 PM] Adam: That ain't enough
[2024-07-03, 3:23:39 PM] Zoe: How many girls are you talking to
[2024-07-03, 3:23:45 PM] Zoe: I don’t care it can be 10
[2024-07-03, 3:23:50 PM] Adam: 0
[2024-07-03, 3:23:51 PM] Zoe: Just out of curiosity
[2024-07-03, 3:23:59 PM] Zoe: Well you should always have more than me
[2024-07-03, 3:24:03 PM] Zoe: I can’t give you enough
[2024-07-03, 3:24:11 PM] Adam: Ok thank-you now tell me
[2024-07-03, 3:24:15 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-07-03, 3:24:39 PM] Zoe: I would not have let you kiss me because I would not default to a non relationship with you
[2024-07-03, 3:24:46 PM] Zoe: I would have let you take me on a date
[2024-07-03, 3:24:57 PM] Zoe: Followed by talking and getting to know each other more
[2024-07-03, 3:25:04 PM] Zoe: 😁
[2024-07-03, 3:25:07 PM] Adam: And then kissing ?
[2024-07-03, 3:25:09 PM] Zoe: To shawarma palace
[2024-07-03, 3:25:21 PM] Zoe: And a kiss in front of the shawarma king
[2024-07-03, 3:25:34 PM] Adam: Cuddles at your place ?
[2024-07-03, 3:25:41 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-07-03, 3:25:46 PM] Adam: Why not
[2024-07-03, 3:26:03 PM] Zoe: I’m looking for love
[2024-07-03, 3:26:06 PM] Zoe: Not to fool around
[2024-07-03, 3:26:20 PM] Adam: I'd have wanted to strip you naked at your place 😂
[2024-07-03, 3:26:30 PM] Zoe: I’m looking for safety
[2024-07-03, 3:26:40 PM] Zoe: You don’t make me feel safe
[2024-07-03, 3:26:52 PM] Zoe: Don’t think you’d protect even my left pinky
[2024-07-03, 3:26:53 PM] Adam: Would you have had cum sex during ovulation?
[2024-07-03, 3:27:04 PM] Zoe: I saw you during my ovulation
[2024-07-03, 3:27:12 PM] Adam: Did you want to ?
[2024-07-03, 3:27:16 PM] Zoe: No
[2024-07-03, 3:27:23 PM] Adam: If he wasn't around
[2024-07-03, 3:27:26 PM] Adam: Would you have let me
[2024-07-03, 3:27:31 PM] Zoe: You don’t even want a relationship now you want to give me a baby?
[2024-07-03, 3:27:44 PM] Adam: If I really wanted to would you have let me ?
[2024-07-03, 3:27:46 PM] Zoe: How on earth did we get back here
[2024-07-03, 3:28:04 PM] Adam: I want to knowwww
[2024-07-03, 3:28:04 PM] Zoe: Same old talk
[2024-07-03, 3:28:07 PM] Adam: I know you want a baby
[2024-07-03, 3:28:08 PM] Adam: Badly
[2024-07-03, 3:28:11 PM] Zoe: I do
[2024-07-03, 3:28:14 PM] Adam: I'm asking would you have taken that risk
[2024-07-03, 3:28:15 PM] Adam: With me
[2024-07-03, 3:28:22 PM] Zoe: I was thinking about going to a sperm bank
[2024-07-03, 3:28:32 PM] Adam: What if I was there
[2024-07-03, 3:28:32 PM] Zoe: I wouldn’t trust you to give me a baby
[2024-07-03, 3:28:41 PM] Adam: Why
[2024-07-03, 3:28:46 PM] Adam: Like I wouldn't follow through
[2024-07-03, 3:28:46 PM] Adam: ?
[2024-07-03, 3:28:52 PM] Zoe: Exactly
[2024-07-03, 3:28:56 PM] Zoe: And that would be so mean
[2024-07-03, 3:28:58 PM] Zoe: Imagine that
[2024-07-03, 3:28:59 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-07-03, 3:29:00 PM] Adam: What if it was guaranteed
[2024-07-03, 3:29:08 PM] Zoe: I don’t play in fantasies
[2024-07-03, 3:29:12 PM] Zoe: Tyler
[2024-07-03, 3:29:17 PM] Adam: I really wanted to this time
[2024-07-03, 3:29:19 PM] Adam: You didn't want it
[2024-07-03, 3:29:21 PM] Zoe: Ttyl
[2024-07-03, 3:29:22 PM] Adam: I was prepared
[2024-07-03, 3:29:25 PM] Zoe: Yeah right
[2024-07-03, 3:29:28 PM] Adam: Why
[2024-07-03, 3:29:34 PM] Adam: I was 10000% prepared
[2024-07-03, 3:29:39 PM] Adam: I was hoping you'd want it
[2024-07-03, 3:29:45 PM] Adam: I'd have done it for sure
[2024-07-03, 3:30:07 PM] Zoe: How can you prepared to give me a baby and not a commitment, really?
[2024-07-03, 3:30:17 PM] Adam: Whichever comes first really
[2024-07-03, 3:30:20 PM] Adam: Baby = commitment
[2024-07-03, 3:30:28 PM] Adam: But I was definitely prepared to cum in you...
[2024-07-03, 3:30:30 PM] Adam: For sure.
[2024-07-03, 3:30:42 PM] Adam: I wouldn't have hesitated
[2024-07-03, 3:33:24 PM] Adam: Why didn't you
[2024-07-03, 3:34:37 PM] Zoe: You knew what I wanted
[2024-07-03, 3:34:41 PM] Zoe: And you couldn’t even
[2024-07-03, 3:34:47 PM] Zoe: Conceive of seeing me
[2024-07-03, 3:34:57 PM] Zoe: Somewhere that would make me comfortable
[2024-07-03, 3:35:08 PM] Zoe: Because that would be you doing too much for me
[2024-07-03, 3:35:15 PM] Adam: No not at all
[2024-07-03, 3:35:17 PM] Zoe: You don’t want to do anything to make me happy
[2024-07-03, 3:35:18 PM] Adam: Doesn't work that way
[2024-07-03, 3:35:24 PM] Adam: You can't make up an equation lol
[2024-07-03, 3:35:28 PM] Adam: And make your own conclusions
[2024-07-03, 3:37:20 PM] Adam: You should have taken the baby
[2024-07-03, 3:37:23 PM] Adam: Would have had it all
[2024-07-03, 3:37:25 PM] Adam: 😂
[2024-07-03, 3:38:08 PM] Zoe: I want to take time before doing anything with you
[2024-07-03, 3:38:15 PM] Zoe: To know if it’s the right decision for me
[2024-07-03, 3:38:19 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-07-03, 3:38:21 PM] Zoe: But you didn’t facilitate that
[2024-07-03, 3:38:25 PM] Zoe: Was nice to see you
[2024-07-03, 3:38:28 PM] Adam: But why did Chris get sex
[2024-07-03, 3:38:33 PM] Adam: Hmm
[2024-07-03, 3:38:38 PM] Zoe: I dunno really
[2024-07-03, 3:38:49 PM] Adam: Wouldn't you rather me?
[2024-07-03, 3:39:17 PM] Zoe: I have what I have for a reason
[2024-07-03, 3:39:25 PM] Zoe: I’m with him because he is here for me
[2024-07-03, 3:39:28 PM] Zoe: And that’s what I like
[2024-07-03, 3:39:33 PM] Zoe: Yes you’re something
[2024-07-03, 3:39:36 PM] Zoe: Exciting
[2024-07-03, 3:39:41 PM] Adam: Sexy?
[2024-07-03, 3:39:46 PM] Zoe: Yes
[2024-07-03, 3:40:08 PM] Adam: Let me ask you something
[2024-07-03, 3:40:17 PM] Adam: Do you think if we had sex, would it have been passionate?
[2024-07-03, 3:40:28 PM] Zoe: It wouldn’t be possible
[2024-07-03, 3:40:33 PM] Zoe: I can’t imagine a scenario
[2024-07-03, 3:40:39 PM] Adam: If we did, would it have been thrilling
[2024-07-03, 3:40:40 PM] Adam: And hot ?
[2024-07-03, 3:40:44 PM] Zoe: I would not have had sex with you
[2024-07-03, 3:40:51 PM] Zoe: Given our relationship
[2024-07-03, 3:41:01 PM] Zoe: Why you think it would have been?
[2024-07-03, 3:41:03 PM] Adam: I'm saying if the walls were lowered in that moment would it have been hot ?
[2024-07-03, 3:41:12 PM] Zoe: Did I live up to your expectations?
[2024-07-03, 3:41:22 PM] Adam: I think it would have been hot and raw?
[2024-07-03, 3:41:39 PM] Adam: Body to body heat, slightly sweating
[2024-07-03, 3:41:41 PM] Adam: Lots of movement
[2024-07-03, 3:42:01 PM] Zoe: Sex isn’t everything
[2024-07-03, 3:42:03 PM] Adam: It would have been sort of rough but not tough
[2024-07-03, 3:42:09 PM] Adam: Not like you think
[2024-07-03, 3:42:18 PM] Zoe: You would have cum in 3 seconds
[2024-07-03, 3:42:20 PM] Adam: Definitely doggy style
[2024-07-03, 3:42:30 PM] Adam: You think so ?
[2024-07-03, 3:42:35 PM] Zoe: Tab
[2024-07-03, 3:42:37 PM] Zoe: Yah
[2024-07-03, 3:42:43 PM] Adam: Why
[2024-07-03, 3:42:51 PM] Zoe: The excitement
[2024-07-03, 3:43:02 PM] Adam: You're staying before I go in
[2024-07-03, 3:43:06 PM] Adam: I'd have finished ?m
[2024-07-03, 3:43:07 PM] Adam: ?*
[2024-07-03, 3:43:10 PM] Zoe: lol no
[2024-07-03, 3:43:14 PM] Adam: Oh
[2024-07-03, 3:43:17 PM] Adam: No I probably wouldn't
[2024-07-03, 3:43:24 PM] Adam: I think maybe
[2024-07-03, 3:43:27 PM] Adam: When it's doggy style
[2024-07-03, 3:43:32 PM] Adam: Yes I'd cum quickly
[2024-07-03, 3:43:42 PM] Adam: It would need to be a different position
[2024-07-03, 3:43:46 PM] Adam: For me to last longer
[2024-07-03, 3:44:16 PM] Adam: For some reason I see it as doggy style though...not sure why that instantly comes to mind lol
[2024-07-03, 3:44:33 PM] Zoe: Then you’d give me that disappointed look and leave right after, post nut and tell me you don’t think we should be together… and I would be heartbroken all over again
[2024-07-03, 3:44:40 PM] Adam: Naaaaah
[2024-07-03, 3:44:42 PM] Zoe: Yah nope not touching you at all
[2024-07-03, 3:44:46 PM] Adam: I'd do it against the wall in your bedroom
[2024-07-03, 3:44:51 PM] Zoe: I don’t feel like talking
[2024-07-03, 3:44:55 PM] Adam: The bed is for cuddles after
[2024-07-03, 3:44:56 PM] Zoe: Ttyl
[2024-07-03, 3:45:04 PM] Adam: Wait lol don't get mad because you assumed
[2024-07-03, 3:45:07 PM] Adam: I'm different.
[2024-07-03, 3:45:23 PM] Adam: I wouldn't have sex with you if I didn't want you
[2024-07-03, 3:45:33 PM] Adam: I'd only do it if I wanted you
[2024-07-03, 3:45:53 PM] Adam: That hair flip definitely did it...
[2024-07-03, 3:45:58 PM] Adam: I couldn't handle it when that happened...
[2024-07-03, 3:48:50 PM] Adam: It's a very seductive look
[2024-07-03, 3:51:53 PM] Adam: Do you know?

[2024-07-03, 4:12:39 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-07-03, 4:12:53 PM] Zoe: Funny
[2024-07-03, 4:12:56 PM] Adam: I just want to know if it's the same feeling I get when I see it
[2024-07-03, 4:12:58 PM] Zoe: It must be tied to a memory
[2024-07-03, 4:13:06 PM] Adam: No not really
[2024-07-03, 4:13:13 PM] Zoe: To a feeling?
[2024-07-03, 4:13:28 PM] Adam: Like I think when your hair is like that you wouldn't mind finishing on your ass...or is that wrong
[2024-07-03, 4:13:34 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-07-03, 4:13:36 PM] Adam: Lol
[2024-07-03, 4:13:41 PM] Adam: I just wanna know if it's right

[2024-07-03, 4:13:46 PM] Zoe: It’s a no go
[2024-07-03, 4:13:51 PM] Adam: You want missionary
[2024-07-03, 4:13:52 PM] Zoe: That girl is not down
[2024-07-03, 4:13:53 PM] Adam: More on top
[2024-07-03, 4:13:57 PM] Adam: Slow
[2024-07-03, 4:13:59 PM] Adam: Relaxed
[2024-07-03, 4:14:10 PM] Adam: Does that make sense ?
[2024-07-03, 4:14:21 PM] Zoe: Do you think I have different personalities?
[2024-07-03, 4:14:37 PM] Adam: Not different personalities.. different moods...
[2024-07-03, 4:14:51 PM] Adam: For some reason I think when your hair is flipped it's more erotic ?
[2024-07-03, 4:14:59 PM] Adam: It's not as slow paced ?
[2024-07-03, 4:15:04 PM] Adam: Kinky in a way ?
[2024-07-03, 4:15:19 PM] Adam: Like would you hate for your ass to be slapped and for him to finish on it ?
[2024-07-03, 4:15:21 PM] Adam: In that mood ?
[2024-07-03, 4:15:29 PM] Adam: Or you would find it pleasurable
[2024-07-03, 4:16:02 PM] Zoe: Probably a mood
[2024-07-03, 4:16:09 PM] Adam: So in that mood
[2024-07-03, 4:16:13 PM] Zoe: But that would be after I loved him
[2024-07-03, 4:16:16 PM] Zoe: And felt safe
[2024-07-03, 4:16:18 PM] Adam: You wouldn't be upset if that happened?
[2024-07-03, 4:16:20 PM] Zoe: To have pleasure like that
[2024-07-03, 4:16:33 PM] Zoe: Honestly you and I aren’t in a relationship to talk about this
[2024-07-03, 4:16:35 PM] Zoe: It’s haram
[2024-07-03, 4:16:41 PM] Adam: It's not about us
[2024-07-03, 4:16:44 PM] Adam: I'm asking if he did it
[2024-07-03, 4:16:49 PM] Zoe: Chris?
[2024-07-03, 4:16:54 PM] Adam: If you were in that hair flipped mood
[2024-07-03, 4:16:59 PM] Adam: And he slapped your bum and came on it
[2024-07-03, 4:17:01 PM] Adam: Would you find it hot
[2024-07-03, 4:17:04 PM] Zoe: I don’t know

[2024-07-03, 4:22:07 PM] Zoe: lol
[2024-07-03, 4:22:13 PM] Zoe: I’m going to shave my head
[2024-07-03, 4:22:20 PM] Zoe: And leave just that part of hair for you
[2024-07-03, 4:22:25 PM] Adam: You look like you're ready to devour someone
[2024-07-03, 4:22:26 PM] Zoe: And flip it like crazy
