# **ExcuseGPT: A NanoGPT Derivative with an Emotional Twist**

### **Overview**
ExcuseGPT is a unique variant of the existing nanoGPT architecture, designed to specialize in generating creative excuses across a spectrum of emotions. It begins with a foundational positive motivation checkpoint, ideally sourced from motivationGPT (though this is optional). Throughout its training regime, ExcuseGPT is enhanced with an array of 500 excuses, distributed across five distinct emotion categories: **NEUTRAL**, **MAD**, **SAD**, **AFRAID**, and **GLAD**.

**Key Features:**
- **Emotion-Sensitive Learning:** Each excuse is tagged with an emotion, allowing for nuanced and contextually relevant output.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The model evolves to generate more precise excuses each time it saves.
- **Compatibility:** Features a FastAPI endpoint for integration and interoperability with OpenAI platforms.

**Training Data Breakdown:**
- **100 Excuses** per emotion category, including a neutral baseline, ensuring a well-rounded emotional response capability.

### **Usage Note**
Itâ€™s important to monitor the temperature settings closely; extremes can significantly impair the quality of the generated excuses.

### **Inspirations and Musings**
- **Seinfeld Influence:** The comedic nuances of Seinfeld have been a great inspiration, offering insights into human behavior and excuse-making.
- **Emotional Exploration:** A prime opportunity to delve into how different emotions influence the formulation of excuses.

### **Model Sample Output**
**Coming Soon...** Stay tuned to witness how ExcuseGPT creatively navigates the art of excuse-making across various emotional states.


## NOTE: This repo also contains the motivational card data. For an experiments I will run the card data, and use that model with the excuse training material.
### CodeMusai thinks it will result in the excuses to have a motivational flair.
